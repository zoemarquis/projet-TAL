"This medium-bodied blend of Grenache, Syrah and Carignan delivers just what you'd expect from the appellation, it just does it better than most, at a modest price.

Yellow rose petals and yellow plums unite on the nose. The palate broadens out into generous earthiness that is textured and broad but kept in beautiful focus by utter freshness. The finish lingers.,24.00,Alsace,Sylvaner

"Lifted notes of dried pear, dried chamomile flowers and dried lemon peel have a strong impact. The palate comes in with lovely generous sweetness that amplifies that chamomile-tisane notion and boosts the dried-fruit notes. Against the distinctly medium-sweet fruitiness stands a clarion line of acidity. The evolution of fruit flavors weaves a colorful tapestry of aromas. This is carefully balanced and quietly intense. It holds immense strength at its core that radiates flavor and fruit. Made from a field blend of Alsace varieties, each adds something: aroma, texture, freshness and body. The finish is endless and very fruity. Have this with cheese or a subtle dessert. Drink now through 2035.",66.00,Alsace,Alsace_white_blend
"A hint of caramelized apple clings to the nose, as well as a certain creaminess. The palate reveals a core of stone, chalk and lanolin, all framed with the purest notion of lemon zest. This shows lovely flavors of maturity but has only just got going. The freshness is incisive, the complexity and length immense. This is simply beautiful and leaves you totally refreshed. Savor this slowly. Drink now through 2030.",38.00,Alsace,Riesling
"An incredibly pure and piercing note of lemon oil hits the nose. The medium-sweet palate impresses with both fresh and dried notes of fruit: plum, white sultana, white currant and the ripest pear and apple you can imagine. This is full-on and big but balanced by tingling, fresh and precise acidity. A field blend of polar opposites, Riesling and Gewurztraminer, this unites their virtues of aromatic textured richness and poised finesse. Again, this is not a wine that is easily categorized with its medium-sweet, soil- and fruit-driven profile, but it is a joy to experience and savor. The finish lasts and lasts. Drink 2017–2035.",50.00,Alsace,Alsace_white_blend
"Tight tannins mask the ripe fruit in a wine that is set for long-term aging, so there is a dry core that dominates at the moment. But not for long: the bold black fruits are insistent and are going to be delicious. This is a structured wine that will be ready in 2026.",60.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A lovely touch of flint and smoke carry a touch of residual reduction. Underneath that is lemony purity. The palate adds a touch of stone fruit, a touch of ripe mirabelle plum—its generosity only underlined by the taut lemon freshness that pervades the wine. There is something stern and stony at the core, something fundamental and profound. The body is precise, dry and powerful and incredibly moreish. This is lip smacking but has not even started to show itself properly. The finish is clean, stony and lasting. This is one to keep. Drink 2020–2040.",50.00,Alsace,Riesling
This is a powerfully structured wine from a 18-acre property on the plateau of Pomerol. Rich Merlot dominates and gives the wine both its alcohol and its intense tannins and juicy red fruits. The wine is dense with the potential for aging over a considerable time. Drink from 2025.,250.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"There is something heady about this: a hint of chamomile tincture and pure lemon zest. The palate cuts in with uncompromising purity and zestiness—this really wants to showcase pure stone and tart citrus. There are glimpses, however, of plump ripe mirabelle plums and a touch of dried pear and quince. Nonetheless, this is governed by stern tanginess and thus is for real adults only. This is dry, slender and shows absolute focus. A celebration of stone and Riesling. Don't drink this now but wait: Drink 2020–2035.",45.00,Alsace,Riesling
"The heady scent of Damask rose hints unmistakably to Gewürztraminer. The palate follows lusciously, generously and luxuriantly: wonderfully sweet notions of peach, ripe apricot and yellow mirabelle plum are perfumed with a rose petal scent but are also pervaded by a gentle citrus freshness that lifts everything. The length is astonishing and dreamy. This is dangerously delicious.",90.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"After a touch of funky reduction, beautiful hints of herbs appear: yarrow and lemon balm play alongside lemon and crisp green-apple aromas. On the palate, these notions all remain taut along a very linear, slender but concentrated body that owes more to citrus than to apples. There is a powerful enduring core of fruit and stone that will make this last. The flavors echo long and leave the mouth totally clean. Drink now through 2035.",44.00,Alsace,Riesling
"This is a wine with great balance and elegance as well as richness. With layers of fine dusty tannins it has a warm character that is repeated in the perfumed fruit and juicy acidity. The wine is impressive, likely to age well. Drink from 2024.",165.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend

"Utter generosity of both ripe and dried pear is immediately evident on the nose. Notions of sandalwood hover. The dry palate carries that same, generous fluidity at its deep core. There is immense concentration, shimmering with dried, fresh and cooked pear. But there also is a sense of earth, stone and fresh orange peel. The wine seems like a message from another world, , leading you beyond the physical, into a wold of contemplation. The finish lasts and lasts.",83.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"The nose is still shy but already tells of tender sweetness. The palate has a rounded earthy smoky element that grounds the luscious generous fruit of dried pear and supersweet Reine Claude and mirabelle plums. The sweetness of this SGN is balanced and almost fresh, but the intriguing thing is a kind of smoky, dark and mysterious core of stone.",90.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"While this wine has plenty of ripe fruit, it also has a smoky character from the wood aging. Red berry fruits give a fresh feel, balanced already with the soft tannins. It's going to develop quickly, so drink from 2016.",18.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend

"This is a serious rosé. It has plenty of fruitiness of course, but it also has texture and the potential to age a few months. The wine is rich, full of red-berry fruits and with a touch of minerality. It is fruity now, but will be best from early 2018.",32.00,Provence,Rosé
"In its singular oval bottle, this is the top cuvée of this prestigious estate close to Saint-Tropez. It is a lively and fruity wine with great acidity and richness.

Drink from late 2017.",40.00,Provence,Rosé

"Medium sweet in character, this is a rich wine that's driven by its rich terroir. The chalk and gravel soil of the Goldert vineyard produces great spiciness that is balanced by delicate acidity and the possibility of aging further. Drink now, but it will be better from 2016.",48.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"The wine has a golden character, warm and ripe. Its rich fruits bring out honeydew melon and pineapple as well as crisper orange zest. The structure and the rich texture are already all there, although it will develop well until 2020.",29.00,Alsace,Riesling
"A wine that is rich in both tannins and ripe fruit. The 45% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend gives the concentration of the wine, with spice and black berry fruits that are given an extra richness by the intense dark plums. The wine needs aging, so drink from 2018.",24.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend

This is refreshing now but will absolutely reward patience. Drink from 2020 through 2035.",100.00,Alsace,Riesling
"The lifted nose seems like an amalgam of chalk and dried apples along with lemon zest. The aromas are reminiscent of evolving Riesling but this is not the only grape in this expressive and highly aromatic field blend. While there is distinct residual sweetness on the palate, this has a counterweight in the rich texture of the midpalate. There is something authentic and deeply comforting and satisfying at the core of this wine that says Alsace. It's impossible to put this wine into a box, it needs to be tasted and enjoyed on its very own terms. The finish is medium sweet, totally soil-driven and very, very long. This is an experience rather than a drink. Drink now through 2035.",98.00,Alsace,Alsace_white_blend

Drink from 2020.",43.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend

It's still developing and will be better from 2018.",20.00,Southwest_France,Gros_Manseng
"A classic vinification in tank and barrel has produced a ripe, full-bodied wine. It has ripe cherry and dark plum fruits; layers of wood-aging flavors give a complete, dense and concentrated wine. It will age, drink until 2020.",24.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"A big, ripe, still very young wine with black fruits that are right up front. It's jammy and juicy, with almost as much fruit as tannin. There is some aging potential, with the underlying dryness of the structure, but the wine is mostly about ripe fruitiness. Drink from 2017.",35.00,Southwest_France,Malbec

"With rich tropical fruits and a ripe, opulent feel, this is a full-bodied wine. It has weight, layers of toast and apricot and peach flavors. Soft and round, it could be drunk now, although it would be best to wait until 2015.",26.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay

"Ripe, soft and very drinkable, this has a generous structure that cushions the tannins with rounded black fruits. The acidity and the warm, generous character of the 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc blend net a fine representation of the fruity 2012s.

"While it is closed and tough at present, this is definitely a wine with a future. The hand-harvested 65% Merlot and 35% Cabernet Franc blend has both firm tannins and the promise of ripe fruits, black berries and a rich, opulent character. Spice and new wood (one-third new French oak) are balanced by the fruits and they are brought together by the acidity at the end. Sophie Lavaud, who has owned the 13-acre estate since 2010, is in the process of getting organic certification.",40.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Intensely perfumed, this wine is also structured and fresh. Combining these elements gives a dense wine, firmly textured and with a dry core. Acidity gives the natural richness lift. It's meant for aging, drink from 2017.",27.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris

"Light and bone-dry, this is crisp, tight and full of lemon and green apple flavors. It's fruity, textured and ready to drink.",14.00,Loire_Valley,Melon

"The nose merely hints at tropical riches. The stony palate also holds tightly onto its fruit: it is only zesty citrus that can be divined amidst all the stone. Bright lemon shines above what seems a deep dark core of rocky earth. There is real drive and real energy in that bright, lemony vein that runs right through this dry, serious and almost brooding wine. The finish adds a touch of a more mellow apple note that persists throughout the long finish. Wait for this. Drink 2020–2035.",45.00,Alsace,Riesling

Drink from 2024.",45.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Lifted heady notes of Damask rose rise from the glass alongside lemony tang. The palate brims with the same rose petal notes but also holds plenty of spice: sandalwood and ginger, white pepper and the merest touch of vanilla. The palate is concentrated and rounded with gentle sweetness, countered by fresh lemon acidity. The persistence of flavors on the palate is incredible. Serve this either with fruity spicy Asian fare or runny, soft and very ripe cheeses.",72.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"The unmistakable yet subtle notes of rose water appear as though they were drizzled over ripe juicy peach flesh. The palate boosts these generous fruit flavors with soft and measured residual sweetness. The medium-dry body is gentle, supple, fluid and generous but punctuated with sprightly, aromatic citrus to strike a harmonious balance. The finish is subtle, clean and perfumed with rose petals. Drink now through 2030.",64.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"Hints of sultana and cooked quince reach the nose suggesting richness. The palate, however, responds with streamlined freshness, ripe fruit and depth and gives us concentration rather than richness. Tangy citrus zest frames notions of ripe apple and quince while shadows of dried fruit still haunt aromatically. The finish is clean, totally satisfying and dry. This is soaring but hearty stuff.",34.00,Alsace,Alsace_white_blend
This is a big wine in its breadth of flavors and structure. Powerful tannins give hints of the wood aging. The ripe black fruit is given a crisp edge by the acidity that is typical of the vintage. The wine will certainly age well. Drink from 2023.,120.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend

"From the tiny vineyard area of Marcillac in the French mountains on the eastern edge of the southwest region, this tight, fruity wine is a breath of fresh air. It is packed with berry fruits as well as tannins showing that it will age. Red fruits burst out at the end. Marcillac's claim to fame is Fer Servidou, the grape that is not related to Cabernet Sauvignon but has similar aroma and taste traits.",16.00,Southwest_France,Fer_Servadou

"Lively and fragrant notes of ripe pear and red apple are immensely appetizing, while the palate is edged with its very own spiciness. The totally moreish ripe-apple freshness pervades and illuminates everything and echoes long. Drink soon while aromas are at their peak.",14.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"Ripe yellow fruits and fragrant acidity dominate this bright, fruity wine. It has a light touch of minerality and a tight steely texture that is full of zest, giving a layered structure of fruit and acidity. The wine, one of the Kuentz-Bas biodynamic range, should age, so drink from 2016.",32.00,Alsace,Riesling

"A touch of flinty reduction clings to the nose but soon relaxes into soft notes of ripe black cherry. The palate is textured and dry, harmonious with fruit and the gentle ripple and crunch of slightly rustic but utterly pleasant tannins. This seems to be its perfect drinking window now: generous with fruit, utterly harmonious and starting to mellow. The finish is fresh, clean and totally moreish. If you can resist at all, this may well continue to develop. Drink now through 2025.",28.00,Alsace,Pinot_Noir

"Owned by the Vialard family, this is a very fine wine. While it does have strong wood flavors at this young stage, they are going to be there to support the ripe jammy fruit.

Drink now through 2030.",35.00,Alsace,Riesling
"A slightly brooding nose suggests brambly fruit as well as freshness. The palate crunches with red and black cherry, imbued with a kind of boyish impish joy. This is disarmingly rustic, but also very, very unusual and utterly moreish in its singular and honest simplicity. Drying tannins coat the mouth while juicy tart freshness makes you want to take another sip. This is all about stormy, romantic wilderness. Beware, this might just steal your heart.",36.00,Alsace,Red_Blend
"Brilliant golden color promises richness. The nose obliges with a seamless scent of apples: fresh and ripe, baked and mellow. The palate shows soaring freshness, but countless notions swirl on the dry palate of this traditional field blend: citrus and apple, pear and blossom. There is so much fruit, so much expression, this is pure exuberance, but in a rather grown-up way. A very apt expression of both the freshness and the richness of Alsace.",24.00,Alsace,Alsace_white_blend
"Heady notes of dried pear mingle with pleasant notes of earth. The palate is totally fluid and concentrated, streamlined with freshness but characterized by a rich luscious vein of sweetness. This is a late harvest to be reckoned with. Concentration and length are impressive and are just now getting into their stride.",72.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
There is just a faint touch of honeysuckle on the nose. The palate follows with creamy floral peach notes on an incredibly light-bodied fluid palate of great intensity and stony depth. It is only on the aftertaste that the full volume and power of these aromatics shine. This feels like the aromatic heart of Alsace itself.,45.00,Alsace,Muscat
"This soft, fruity wine is pretty much ready to drink. With its red-berry fruits and fresh acidity it has a crisp side, although its round, ripe texture is so attractive. Drink from the end of 2016.",40.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir

"With 45% Mourvèdre and 35% Cinsault this has turned into a highly flavored and aromatic wine. It has great fruits and a rich texture that has a herbal edge.

"Apricot compote and candied peach shine on nose and palate with great intensity. The overtly floral notes of rose have given way to a more subtle perfume that highlights the aromas of peach above all. This is very concentrated, very rich, but also precise and fresh. It is citrus tanginess that allows this to be sweet yet still refreshing. Medium to sweet finish.",45.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"There is something floral and tender, even creamy on the nose. The palate on the one side has a creamy apricot and peach aspect, on the other a totally taut and brisk lemon-lime streak. This makes for tension and interest. This is concentrated and exciting, dry and very, very enjoyable. Drink now through 2025.",37.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Tender notes of honeysuckle and rose rise from the glass. On the palate they perfume the generous peach and mirabelle plum fruit, supported by some residual sweetness. This strikes a very harmonious balance between tender opulence an sprightly freshness. The finish is intense, tangy, medium sweet and superbly balanced.",32.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"The nose is a very enticing mix of rose petal and peach, grapefruit zest and musky spice. The palate echoes the same flavors and is both intense and concentrated. There is residual sweetness making all the fruit flavors luscious and plump, countered by sprightly fresh acidity that results in an over all medium-sweet wine. The flavors are precise and clean and so is the finish.",34.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer

"Naturally low yields in a parcel within the Holder vineyard give concentration and great depth of flavor. The wine is still dominated by acidity, tense texture and a strongly steely character. Dry, nervy, needing to age, the wine has potential. Drink from 2017.",25.00,Alsace,Riesling

"This wine is lean and austere, with extracted tannins that have left no sense of fruit. It will remain hard, although it will be less dry from 2018.",18.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Gravel and limestone soils provide two different origins for this wine. That said, burnt wood and smoky tannins are the only tastes at the moment. the wine does have enough weight and potential to soften out, so drink from 2017.",30.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This is attractively fruity, crisp and perfumed. With red currant fruits and refreshing acidity, it's fresh and light in character. Drink now.",13.00,Bordeaux,Rosé
"Heavy wood aromas lead to a wine that's dominated by burnt wood with only subdued fruit. It's packed with tannins that are tough and extracted, giving a bitter coffee flavor. Although it will soften, the wine will likely keep its dry, tough character.",40.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Considerable toasted wood flavors show from both the aroma and the initial taste. The fruit is lean, without the weight needed for balance. It's likely to remain an austere wine.",18.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This is a ripe, red-fruit dominated wine with rich strawberry and cream flavors that are immediately attractive, With its balanced acidity, the wine is ready to drink now.",14.00,Bordeaux,Rosé

"This is a rich, soft wine with jammy black fruits and ripe tannins. The acidity will hold the wine together and allow it to age. A mineral edge comes from the caillou (stones) in the soil—hence the wine's name. It will age, although quickly, so drink from 2018.",70.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"In the village of Soussans, and in the north of the Margaux appellation, this estate has a fine reputation for its wines. This vintage, with its great balance between fruit and tannins, shows why. It is a ripe wine full of black fruit and with the bright acidity of the vintage. Drink the wine from 2021.",21.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend

"Owned by the Cuvelier family of Léoville Poyferré in Saint-Julien and with Michel Rolland as consultant, this is a fine estate with an equally fine chateau. It is dense and richly endowed with black fruits and spice. At the same time, it has style and a way with its fruit and acidity that give it a lift. Drink this very ageworthy wine from 2023.",34.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"With swathes of delicious herbal and green Sauvignon Blanc fruit just delicately underpinned by the wood aging, this is a wine that is rich while remaining so crisp. It is the tangy grapefruit and crisp texture that will allow this wine to age. Drink from 2020.",150.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"This is a structured wine that also has great layers of rich black fruits. They give the wine weight and intensity that is lifted by acidity. It is a powerful complex wine, concentrated and ripe. Drink from 2025.",50.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The nose needs air but as it wakes up, subtle notes of fragrant baked peach rise. On the palate a streak of lemon freshness provides both frame and direction, alongside a lovely apple-skin texture. Made from a blend of Riesling, Pinot Gris and Gewürztraminer this unites the virtues of each variety. This is full of life and impresses with its great precision and freshness. The finish is bone dry. Lovely now but will age. Drink now through 2025.",27.00,Alsace,Alsace_white_blend
"The intense aroma of very ripe peach rises from the glass. There are nuances of orange peel, too. These become aromatically amplified on the rich, dense and almost grippy palate. There is great concentration and residual sweetness, countered by bitter pith and texture. This is mature and totally fluid, ample and generous but its maturity adds subtle tone to the eloquent aromas. The finish is medium dry and very, very long.",25.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"This wine clearly needs to breathe. It is only after a few minutes of airtime that it shows its true colors: then very tart and aromatic apples appear, alongside a hint of smoke and a sheer touch of lemon freshness. The palate continues on that lemony streak and is absolutely dry. The body is lithe and slender and shows great freshness and intensity. Apple and stone flavors linger. Drink 2020–2030.",53.00,Alsace,Riesling
"There is a touch of smoke and stone that lends a darker aspect to the ripe but crisp apple fruit. The palate has that same taut but very full-fruited feel—of very tightly held ample fruit reminiscent of red-cheeked, aromatic apples. This is both powerful and svelte. The palate is dry and finishes very clean, leaving you with haunting apple notes and fresh lemon.",38.00,Alsace,Riesling
"The gentlest floral hint is suggested on the nose. The palate, on the other hand, broods and does not want to let go of its flavors. The dry palate is stony, textured and clean but it does not yet let any fruit speak. There is real concentration and length, but it clearly is too early to enjoy this. The finish gives a suggestion of apple, but we had better wait. Drink 2020–2030.",35.00,Alsace,Riesling
"From a small region just north of Pouilly Fumé, this is light and fruity. It's soft, just herbaceous and full of green apple and grapefruit flavors that give a fresh, lively character. It's completely ready to drink.",20.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Fresh and fruity, this is classic cool climate rosé. It has as much fresh apple as red berry fruits in its light, tight texture. It's crisp and ready to drink.",20.00,Loire_Valley,Rosé
"Big, fat and juicy, this wine has soft tannins and a full-bodied structure. It is full of the superripe Merlot that characterizes 2009, making the wine develop relatively quickly. It should be ready to drink by 2016.",25.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This is a wine with austerity and a dry, firm structure. It does have fruit to give weight to its tannins and texture. With spice as well as flavors of wood aging, it's likely to age well. Drink from 2017.",75.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Rich and structured, it is full of ripe berry fruits and dense tannins. It is solid and balanced, with concentration and a very ripe feel. It needs to age a few years, so drink from 2017.",17.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This is a serious wine from a classic vintage. While it has lost its fruit, it has gained in depth with secondary aromas of toast and leather, still kept fresh by acidity and a touch of juiciness. Drink now.",45.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Initially rough around the edges, this wine opens up to give warm red berry fruits, firm tannins and a solid structure. Underlying tannins give a dry core. A more juicy, fresh aftertaste means this wine needs some aging. Drink from 2017.",25.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This juicy Merlot/Cabernet Franc blend is balanced and fresh with great red fruits and soft tannins. Acidity gives a crisp flavor while the fragrant smokiness allows for future development. This comes from a nine-acre, high-density, hand-picked parcel on a limestone plateau among the Querre family vineyards. Drink from 2017.",18.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Rich and spicy, this 90% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon from 10 acres generous and ripe, with warm tannins and a fruity, red berry character. This blend has attractive acidity and spicy flavors from the combination of wood and stainless-steel aging. This is only the second vintage from enologist Jean-Rémi Larrat's own property. It is worth aging, so drink from 2017.",16.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The ninth generation of the Dublois family goes for tight cropping on only 7.5 acres for Nectar (95% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon). Layers of wood dominate this wine. However, it does promise fruit as well, shown by the weight and richness. So it's a wine for a pause, to allow the intense spice and new wood flavors to die down. Firm and dry now, it will be worth the wait. Drink from 2018.",35.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"There is a lovely, poised balance between fresh, crisp fruitiness and peppered spice in this wine made from the increasingly rare Chasselas. It is light, flavored with apple and quince, very attractive and ready to drink now.",22.00,Alsace,Chasselas
"The wine is rich, full in the mouth and delicious. With its creamy texture, baked apple flavors and sprinkling of spice, it's a dense and ripe wine that could be drunk now, but which will be better in 2016.",26.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"With its ripe and perfumed character, the wine is not quite dry. It's already maturing, with its fruity acidity muted by almonds, ripe pear skins and a tight, mineral texture. This intense wine will be ready by 2015.",22.00,Alsace,Riesling

"This is a firm wine with ripe Merlot fruits that are still sheathed in tannins. Densely textured, it is rich with berries and a stalky character that needs to soften. Wait for this solid, concentrated and ageworthy wine until 2017.",65.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This is a soft wine, full of ripe apple and white currant fruit flavors. It's fresh , but also has a steely edge that gives a strong texture. Produced from chalk and clay soils, it is tight, rich and needs a few months more in bottle. Drink from 2017.",19.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"An perfumed wine, this is light and fruity. Bright raspberry flavors are lifted by refreshing acidity and a tang of zesty lemon. A touch of minerality gives texture. Drink now.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Rosé

"The vineyard is on the slopes of the Massif des Maures, on the way to Saint-Tropez. This special cuvée is ripe and full in the mouth. It has a bone-dry texture, balancing fruit and spice. This serious wine will be ready from late 2017.",20.00,Provence,Rosé
This is both fruity and deliciously crisp. It has the light touch of the vintage—red fruits attractively balancing with the acidity and the tangy lemon edge. The aftertaste is both fruity and herbal. Drink now.,22.00,Provence,Rosé
"For its youth, this is a rich, smooth wine. The tannins, even from the Malbec in the blend, are full, rounded and already integrated. Acidity and an attractive smokiness give this wine its already-drinkable character. Drink from the end of 2015.",15.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This is a blend from Aÿ on the Montagne de Reims and from the Côte des Blancs. It is intensely perfumed, with weight from Pinot Noir and crispness from Chardonnay. If it seems not quite integrated at this stage, it will hopefully come together over the next few years to reveal a ripe and rich wine. Drink from 2017.",55.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
The chalk subsoil of the Bélingard estate gives this wine its textured character. The wood aging smoothes out the crisp acidity of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon and adds a light layer of toast. It is still a young wine and will be better from late 2016 or even 2017.,13.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"From vines planted to the west of Chablis, this is a soft, ripe and fruity wine. It has some tension from the minerality while keeping the white fruit flavors to the fore. Drink now or, better, from late 2016.",19.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay

"This is a tough wine, packed more with tannins than fruit. A bitter chocolate character comes from over-extraction of the tannins. The fruit is slow in coming, although there are hints of juiciness. Give it until 2017.",15.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The 56 acres of this estate are in the heart of the Entre deux Mers region. This young and fruity wine has stalky black currant fruits and fresh acidity. There's a light touch of spicy wood and a crisp, red fruit aftertaste.",16.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
This lean wine lacks fruit to support the dry tannins. That probably comes from the extraction that has also caused some bitterness. It's a hard wine that needs time to soften.,18.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"From one of two properties in Listrac owned by the Thomas family (the other is Reverdi), this is seriously dark and tannic, with flavors of bitter chocolate extract and wood. It doesn't feel as if it will really soften enough.",28.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A separate cuvée produced from the vineyard of Château Beaumont, this has an earthy aroma, dense and extracted tannins, and still needs to find its balance. If it is to round out, it will need several years, although it could well remain tough.",16.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
Strong wood aromas continue into the palate of this burnt toast and bitter-chocolate-flavored wine. It is extracted and with a bitter edge. The juiciness from the fruit only emerges slowly and tentatively.,25.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Protected by the Massif de Sainte-Baume, kept dry and sunny with the Mistral winds that blow down the Rhône Valley, this vineyard can produce ripe wines like this. It has a crisp cool feel to it, bright with acidity as well as red currant and tangy orange. This is a delicious wine, with a fruity aftertaste.",12.00,Provence,Rosé
"This is a rounded, ripe and full-bodied wine, with spice and light toastiness that give richness. Apple and green-plum flavors are enhanced by the creamy texture and touches of apricots. It is young and drinkable now, although will likely be much better from the end of 2016.",40.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Full in the mouth, this rich wine comes from vineyards in the hillside valley above Puligny-Montrachet. It has something of the same balance between ripe fruit and a steely texture. The acidity is there, embedded in the toast and ripe pear flavors. Drink from 2017.",50.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"There's been an evolution taking place at this house, with new oak no longer ubiquitous in the offerings. In fact, this wine is aged solely in concrete, which allows charming hints of lavender and thyme to shine among the cherry and cocoa notes. It's full-bodied yet firm, so pair it with burgers or steaks off the grill.",21.00,Rhône_Valley,Grenache-Syrah
"This is a silky, ready-to-drink red. Cherry and plum fruit mingle easily with earth, leather and mocha, finishing on a softly dusty note. Drink now–2023.",37.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"From a high altitude estate in the Vaucluse, this blend of 60% Grenache, 35% Syrah and 5% Cinsault is pale and coppery in hue, yet shows ample richness and weight on the palate. Notes of wet stone, berry and citrus linger on the mouthwatering finish.",30.00,Rhône_Valley,Rosé
"This fresh, crisp wine has plenty of lively citrus fruits that are enriched by red apple and zesty orange flavors. The wine is already delicious in its fruitiness and ready to drink.",25.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Slightly funky notions appear first: There's a hint of reduction but this, thankfully, blows off. Underneath sits a very sprightly, very fresh wine that pits fruity apple mellowness against total, dry freshness. This has a concentrated core, the aromas are still a little tinged by the flinty, smoky hints of reduction but this will stand them in good stead for cellar age. Give this some time. Drink 2020–2030.",46.00,Alsace,Riesling
"A lovely lemony lift jumps from the glass and immediately signals maturing Riesling. The palate is still taut with freshness but has the harmonious balminess of bottle age. Hints of dried pear and candied lemon peel appear. The palate is as precise and taut as ever, brightened by utter apple and citrus crispness. The finish is long, dry and utterly clean cut.",36.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Beautifully pure notes of crisp Cox's Orange Pippin apples shine on the nose. The palate is equally tart and wonderfully refreshing. This is a high-wire act of freshness and stony depth. You think you can almost taste the stone underneath all of these beautifully expressed apple notes that are pervaded by zesty freshness. What an invigorating, lip-smacking finish. This is lovely now but will develop. Drink now through 2030.",35.00,Alsace,Riesling
"This estate, dating to the 18th century and close to the Gironde estuary, has produced a rich wine. Young tannins and fine fruity acidity are both present in a wine that is serious and dense. Its weight, ripeness and the potential of the black-currant fruit will all allow it to age. Drink from 2022.",42.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Lifted hints of chamomile and apple peel rise straight from the glass. The palate has the same streamlined citrus focus and just homes in on that sleek dry apple freshness that seem to be a dynamic force at the center of this wine. The flavors are concentrated and totally dominated by utter lemon freshness, tart and vivid to the last. Lovely now but with further potential. Drink now through 2030.",50.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Subtle hints of tart apples appear first, then there is the merest touch of quince, even a touch of lemon balm. The palate pans out aromatically, always in that apple and quince spectrum, and has a brightening crisp edge of freshness and absolute concentration and dryness. With more air, the aromatic lemon balm note adds its special perfume to this wine. This is invigorating and enlivening.",38.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Made from a separate parcel of the Valandraud estate, this is a fruity, ripe wine. Dark tannins and flavors of dark chocolate combine with great fruit and acidity. It is still packed with tannins and will take plenty of time to come round. Drink from 2024.",55.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The richest and most generous hints of dried pear and fruit loaf rise from the glass. The palate continues in the same, generous vein with plenty of pear, shimmering and scintillating with juicy, mellow and just off-dry ripeness. This is countered by fresh lemon zestiness and leaves a totally balanced and very lasting impression. There are pleasant highlights of bitterness and that pervasive sense of pear fruit just lasts and lasts.",45.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"Rounded and rich, this single-vineyard wine is concentrated without losing a touch of its beautiful fruit. It has a fine balance between fruit and acidity as well as a tense line of minerality and tight texture. Drink this impressive wine from 2024.",140.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Rich aromas of juicy peach and Damask rose have the lovely and tempering edge of grapefruit zest. The palate gives us the same welcomed counterpoint of zesty aromatic freshness and perfumed opulence. This has lovely fluid freshness, couched in sumptuous flavors. This is exquisitely balanced and finishes just about still dry.",46.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"A lovely mix of gentle rose petal, sandalwood and honeysuckle perfumes the nose.

There is ample freshness here but also an earthy and (for now) citrus-fruited generosity. The finish reverts to stony, earthy cleanness. This is intriguing and needs time to unfold its fruit and unusual texture. Drink 2020–2030",30.00,Alsace,Riesling
The nose is like a veil of Golden Delicious apple scent. The palate follows with soft apple freshness that is pervaded by a deeper lemony streak. But it is apple charm that stays on the surface. There are hints of wax and stone too. The dry intense palate is concentrated and clean. Apple and lemon notes linger and leave the palate utterly clean.,53.00,Alsace,Riesling

"This is its usual opulent, generous self, although in 2011 the fruit dominates. Ripe strawberry fruits are packed around sweet tannins and balanced with acidity.

"This producer has a well-deserved reputation for preserving rare vines varieties. In this case, the Petit Courbu and the even rarer Arrufiac are blended with the more familiar Gros Manseng. It is a dry wine although the perfumed acidity and the crisp clean pear and apricot flavors give it a soft, ripe character. Drink the wine now.",17.00,Southwest_France,White_Blend
"Wood-laden, spicy wine with some ripe black currant fruit and soft tannins. This is a warm, open wine that is likely to age over the next year.",17.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend

"While there is probably plenty of ripe fruit somewhere in this wine, it is all too much dominated by high toast wood flavors which will likely always give a tough character. It only just hints at a more generous side.",17.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A round and full flavored wine. It is soft with apple and pear flavors, lifted by a touch of lemon zest. There is some weight to this ripe, dry, finally crisp wine. Keep for a few more months.",15.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"This is a solid, concentrated wine from a reliable chateau. It has weight and power, with rich black fruits balanced with fresh acidity.

"Very textured, this is a complex wine. There is a strong sense of minerality here, along with flavors of ripe apricots, peaches and grapes.

"A rich Riesling, just off dry, balancing intense acidity with white currant, hedgerow fruits and a concentrated texture. The wine is full-bodied, very ripe and superbly structured. Very fruity now, this is a wine to show how well Riesling can age—give it 6–8 years.",39.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Pale gold-colored wine from an exceptional vineyard. The warmth of the volcanic soil gives richness to the fruit while still keeping some feeling of dryness. It has weight, dried spice and pepper. Honeyed fruits show right at the end. Drink from 2014.",60.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"A beautiful wine, fully mature and wonderfully ripe. It has all the elements of mature Pinot Gris: great swathes of spice, almonds, a good slash of acidity and honeyed sweetness. It's not going to improve but could stay at this level for three to five years.",40.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"An opulent feeling Riesling, full of peach and pineapple flavors. It's ripe, full in the mouth and textured, its richness masking the dryness of the fruit and the acidity. It could age a few more years—give it 2–4.",24.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Mango aromas drive this rich wine, full of honey as well as spicy fruits. It is not so much weighty as intense, with a sense of warmth. Now mature and ready to drink, it still retains a youthful fruit character.",40.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer

"The name is an oblique reference to Shiraz, which forms the basis of this cuvée. It's inky in hue and rather reticent on the nose at first. But swirl it vigorously and be rewarded with layers of cassis, blackberry and black pepper. Full bodied, rich and tannic, its blueberry and cassis fruit lingers on the long, mouthwatering finish. Drink 2015–2025.",30.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend

"Rich and fruity, this wine is finely balanced, with juicy black-plum fruit and acidity. The Merlot gives it a smoky character and a ripe, fleshy texture. Age this for 3–4 years.",14.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A heady and lifted nose suggests healing herbs steeped in honey. The palate is rich and unctuous but fresh with the lemon peel, herb and clear honey notes that were already present on the nose. The balance between luscious and tart is on a knife's edge and all the more thrilling for it. The flavors last and last—not in sweetness but in utter, gloried freshness. Drink 2016–2040.",75.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"The spicy, evocative scent of Seville orange peel entices from the first sniff. The palate is dry, restrained and sylph-like but with time reveals tangerine and lemon zest. This is a feast, a celebration of citrus flavors, unfolding and shimmering at every moment. This is dry but faceted, taut but playful. Irresistible now but with a brilliant, aromatic and totally seductive future ahead. Drink 2016–2030.",53.00,Alsace,Riesling
"The subtle, rounded but rather aromatic perfume of peach skins and apricot compote on the nose is utterly seductive—there is a promise of oriental riches and exotic spice but above all pure, glowing peach fruit. The palate is in total focus: while some residual sugar illuminates every last vestige of fruit, there is guiding central force that never lets this slip into the merely opulent. A masterful tightrope walk amidst plump fruit and mineral precision with a finishing, pleasantly bitter edge of marzipan.",120.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"The nose is heady and fragrant, edged with dried chamomile and hay flowers and subdued honey. Underneath that is a notion of sweet, luscious apricot compote. With time, there are the most subtle notes of enticing pine resin and fir honey—lit and illuminated all the way by the purest and most concentrated of lemon acidity. A triumph of balance and richness.",90.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"Very enticing but ever so ethereal notes of tropical fruit are hinted at: yellow and pink grapefruit, passion fruit and even some pineapple. The palate is still in thrall to all the primary citrus notes but holds promise of stone and riper fruit. This is taut, elegant, concentrated, dry and whistle-clean. Like a superlative sports car waiting to be sped around a race track. This spells raciness, subtle power and linearity. What a super-clean finish. Drink 2020–2035.",50.00,Alsace,Riesling
"The purity of juicy, tart, red apples runs like a fault line through a very taut, linear, whistle-clean Riesling. This has purity and precision, linearity and drive. Still tightly wound, this needs time to unfold but promises to be a wine of great longevity and expression. Resolutely dry, the purity and concentration of flavors will always remain. Drink 2018–2030.",50.00,Alsace,Riesling
"A perfumed note of citrus peel and soft pine create a bracing nose that nonetheless suggests ripeness. The body is lithe and light, with a backdrop of stone and subtle nuttiness. With a little more air, the characteristic notes of mature Riesling appear: some lifted chamomile and candied orange peel, but only in their early stages. This is a wine of immense depth and deceptive lightness that has years of life ahead. Drink through 2030.",60.00,Alsace,Riesling
"The initially sumptuous notions of peach are quickly tinged by a more intriguing note of smoke. Honeyed notes join in before they explode on the palate into a rich, lemon-caramel flavor. This has concentration and verve and cuts its sweetness admirably, so much so that this becomes a lip-smacking tightrope walk of lush, sweet caramel and tight, spritzy lemon zest. Exciting.",60.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"A shy nose opens onto a fruit-driven, scented palate of honeyed pear. Flavors are delicate but well-defined, the purity of the honey notes is astonishing and appetizing. Balance comes from a golden vein of citrus freshness. This is subtle and sweet: you need to let this come towards you slowly and let the waves of balanced sweetness unfold. This is a very elegant, impressive vendange tardive.",72.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"Incredibly pure notes of freshly cut Cox's Orange Pippin assail the nose. The palate has the same purity and a linear, taut, rich but toned body that is yet to reveal all of its secrets. The purity and luminoisty of the fruit is astonishing. We have not seen the best of this yet. For now the purest apple fruit delights. This is deliciously concentrated and very youthful. Drink 2016–2030.",40.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Sweet, yes, but so light that it has no time to be cloying. This is a balanced wine: acidity playing off the honey and apricot to give a wine that will make a great apéritif. Fruity and crisp at the end, it is ready to drink.",16.00,Southwest_France,Gros_Manseng

"This is a finely balanced wine. With its tannins so well integrated with the blackberry fruit, it is going to be a juicy while structured wine. The dry core is likely to open up as it develops. Drink this attractive wine from 2020.",29.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"With low yields after a hail storm, the wine is concentrated and dense. It has a touch of wood aging as well as dark black fruits. The tannins are firm in a wine that will age well over the medium term. Drink from 2023.",25.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
Beautifully pure cherry notes are subdued on the nose and fight against the privations of the 2014 vintage. There is lip-smacking freshness and admirable concentration on the textured palate with its velvety folds. The finish is clean and dry. Drink now through 2019.,55.00,Alsace,Pinot_Noir
"A closed nose leads to a gently concentrated palate of tart aromatic red-cherry fruit pervaded by conifer notes.

This is aromatic, elegant and long.",38.00,Alsace,Pinot_Noir
"Fresh notes of crunchy red cherry have a spicy edge of pepper. The body of this slender Pinot Noir is very light, totally peppery and very appetizing. The structure is soft and very refreshing. This could also be chilled and is a fabulously light-bodied but sprightly lunch red. The finish is perfectly dry and very enlivening.",20.00,Alsace,Pinot_Noir
"An aromatic hint of pine mixes with the red cherry notes on the nose, creating a very appetizing opening. The ultralight palate is translucent and slender, with the same leafy conifer aromas and lots and lots of red currant brightness and freshness. The light crunchy nature of this wine suggests that this is ideal for chilling. It's a weightless, very aromatic, and ultra-light-bodied red.",17.00,Alsace,Pinot_Noir
A clean-cut nose of green pear leads onto an equally clean-cut palate of fresh pear. There is freshness and lots of lemony brightness on the light but precise palate. This is appetizing and moreish.,17.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc

"You can tell this is a prestige cuvée by the weight and shape of the bottle. The wine does justify its packaging, a rich and smooth offering that's structured and textured without losing sight of generous fruitiness. Orange peel combines with red berries to give a full while fresh wine. Try aging it for a few more months and drink at the end of 2015.",33.00,Provence,Rosé
"Made from 60-year-old vines from a property next door to Vosne-Romanée, this wine is both structured and rich. It has dark tannins, with juicy and jammy plum fruits that are layered with acidity. It is still firm, dense and needs time. Drink from 2020.",124.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This beautifully perfumed wine has rounded tannins finely integrated into the opulent red cherry fruit. It's already a delicious wine, juicy and fragrant, although still with a long future. If you can wait, drink it from 2018.",92.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir

"A steely wine, it's tight with acidity and apple fruit flavors. It has a brighter, crisper side, but the wine is still nervy and textured. Acidity at the end means it can age. Drink from 2016.",36.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"The wine shows the rich wood flavors with the same intensity as the red fruits. It is firm and somewhat extracted with licorice and dark chocolate coming through the cherry fruits. At the end, the solid wood is dominant, meaning the wine needs time. Drink from 2017.",60.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir

The texture is supple, turning velvety on the finish, which makes it accessible now. Drink it over the next few years.",125.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend

"It's pricey for a Vin de Pays, but it's basically a baby Côte Rôtie, made from Syrah grown on steep slopes in the Northern Rhône. Raspberry aromas blend with hints of cracked pepper and a hint of hickory-smoked bacon, while the palate adds flavors of espresso and black olive to the mix. Silky and long on the finish. Drink now–2018, and possibly beyond.",87.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah

What it does deliver is a world of weight and texture on the palate, along with notions of toasted nuts and grilled fruit (melon and pineapple). Ready to drink now.",40.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend

"The aromas are of wood as much as fruit. While the palate also shows plenty of wood aging flavors, there is also a more floral, red berry fruit character that's already attractive. The acidity at the end gives intense freshness.",15.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"With dense fruit and a powerful, complex structure, this is one of the best wines from this chateau. Blackberries, black plums and a rich, generous character are all here, along with fine tannins. Drink this great success from 2018.",55.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend

It's a wine both for short-term fruitiness and long-term power and density. Drink from 2017.",100.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend

"Firmly in the style of the vintage, this is dense, full-bodied Cornas, with plenty of fruit. Intense plum, coffee and black olive notes dominate, while the tannins are ripe and plush. Believe it or not, this is actually drinkable now, yet should age easily through at least 2025.",84.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah

"Ripe Mirabelle plums and tart, red apples mix to give a very fruity, appetizing aspect which on the palate is joined by ripe, lemony freshness. This has the balance and drama everyone wishes for in dry Riesling: both generous fruit and ample freshness. Lovely now but with the balance and concentration to last. Lovely Mirabelle finish of immense length. Drink 2016–2026.",30.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Soft perfume susbsumes citrus, apple and peach. All three are referenced in equal measure on the dry, clean palate. This has a soft aspect but is nonetheless fresh, taut, concentrated and linear. It comes with huge charm and clarity and finishes with pure, zesty dryness and pure, pervasive and lasting apple notes. Still young, oozing potential. Drink 2017–2030.",35.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Stone, earth and hay are about to merge into notions of lanolin and chamomile: clearly this is a maturing wine at an early point of its evolution. The palate is fluid and has the texture of drenched chalky, stone. The fruit is hiding in the wings, only to appear as orange oil here or as apple scent there. The dryness shows every nuance of this earthy, wine from a historic, co-planed vineyard of Riesling, Pinot Gris and Gewurztraminer. What a triumph. Drink 2016–2026.",49.00,Alsace,Alsace_white_blend
"A wealth of notions hits the palate: baked apple, fir honey, lemon-scented caramel and burnt sugar. The palate does not hold back, either, and lets all these notions dance in swirls of dizzying richness. Caramel-crusted apricots glow in the background while everything is lit up with bright, fresh acidity, highlighting apricot, apple and honey.",145.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"This is a full-bodied wine that exudes yellow fruits and a smooth structure. It is ripe, packed with citrus acidity to keep it fresh while the mineral texture is so well-cushioned by the rich fruitiness. It is delicious now with the exuberance of young fruit although it will certainly age and will be even better from 2017.",44.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"The nose is still closed, there is an almost smoky aspect and a promise of far more perfume in the future. The palate comes with great concentration of still tightly coiled lemon zest notes but the aftertaste is almost salty. This is dry, linear, muscular and toned, affording glimpses of future grandeur through dense lemon and lime zestiness. Give this some time in bottle. Drink 2018–2030.",57.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Very pure notes of red apple and Bosc pear on the nose relax into a juicy, delicious mix on the dry, poised palate. The abundance of fruit cannot conceal the absolute purity and concentration at the core of this dry, structured wine. This strikes a wonderful balance and finishes dry and long.",40.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Softly scented with tart apple and fresh citrus, this unfolds into an array of shimmering, tart, fresh but full-fruited apple notes.

Drink 2016–2026.",40.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Fulsome notes of ripe, juicy pear lead straight to a fluid, concentrated palate that holds a whole world of ripe pear flavors. This is still deep in its shell, ringing with primary fruit but burying many layers of spiced joy: think marzipan and gingerbread. This is one for laying down that will reward patient drinkers. The deep core of fruit, the concentration on the midpalate and the ultraclean finish all suggest a great future. Drink 2018–2028.",105.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris

"The nose is reminiscent of dried pine cones and miso. It is only on the palate that some fruit appears: Hints of red cherry mix with the same pine notes and are fringed with pleasant bitterness. The palate is light in weight but concentrated. This calls out for food—think game and mushroom dishes. The finish is juicy, refreshing and moreish.",30.00,Alsace,Pinot_Noir
There is a hint of earth and roasted pumpkin on the nose. The palate has a similarly smoky and dusky aspect and surrounds crisp red-cherry fruit. The body is light with a slight but fine tannic grip. A pleasantly bitter finish counters the pumpkin richness. The finish is very fresh and dry but strangely moreish. This will benefit from a bit of bottle age. Drink now through 2022.,45.00,Alsace,Pinot_Noir
Bosc pear plays on nose and palate. The ripe and aromatic fruit is countered by ample freshness and even a little spice on the palate. There is a wonderful crispness to the body and the finish. That lasting sense of pears makes you want to sip again.,19.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc

"Lovely notes of ripe apple with an orange peel touch play on the nose. They also appear on the dry, juicy and very fruit-driven palate. All is driven and slender, fresh but ripe. The fruit is so burgeoning that this is still juicy, even on the apple-scented finish.",30.00,Alsace,Riesling
"It is the freshness of mandarin peel and jasmine that draws you in, as well as the lifted scent. The palate is light and dry with rose petal and tangerine making a charming twin appearance. Lovely and light, it's very attractive.",22.00,Alsace,Muscat
"Closed up and just hinting at its great potential, this wine is showing tannins and a dry, solid core. Slowly it reveals delicious, opulent red berry fruits and concentrated texture. It needs a lot of time before drinking; wait until 2019.",68.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Onion-skin pink in color, this wood-aged wine is opulent and ripe. It is textured, with generous red fruits that are given a great lift by the spice and pepper that fill the mouth and give the wine power and richness. The acidity is well integrated, finishing the wine with freshness. A far cry from so many fruity rosés, this is a serious wine.",90.00,Provence,Rosé
"From the mountains inland from Saint-Tropez, this finely textured and deliciously fruity wine from old vines is a blend of 50% Cinsault and 50% Mouvedre.

"This is as serious as Provence rosé can get. It is a limited production wine, selected from the best Grenache (75%) and Syrah (25%) parcels. Structured and impressively dense, its red fruits are concentrated, bone-dry and with a textured character. It is ready to drink although it will become richer from early 2016. The Sumeire family arrived in the Sainte Victoire mountain range in the 13th century.",60.00,Provence,Rosé
"From a half-acre parcel, this is a delicately structured wine. Delicious, forward red-cherry fruits are juicy and provide lift to the the firm tannins. The combination and balance of the fruit and the texture result in a wine that will age well. Drink from 2018.",100.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"The chalky soil conveys a cool feeling to this wine. Tight and mineral, it has yellow fruits that show good acidity. Toasty wood gives a juicy aftertaste. It's already delicious, but the wine's cool character will develop further, so drink from 2016.",55.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay

"This is a bit rustic, but in a very good way, offering vast complexity in a biodynamically produced blend that's 50% Grenache, 25% Syrah and 25% Mourvèdre. Tack-room aromas of leather and liniment combine with pepper and clove scents on the nose, while the palate adds just enough cherry fruit and supple plushness to make it easy to drink. Drink it over the next year or two.",26.00,Rhône_Valley,G-S-M
"This well-proportioned wine has ripe fruits along with generous texture and acidity. A touch of wood gives extra weight. It's ready to drink, but will be even better by the end of 2014.",20.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Crisp acidity and citrus fruitiness combine with a riper, textured character. The wine shows the strong minerality inherent in whites from Pernand-Vergelesses, as well as a richer streak. Because of its structure, it should age. Drink from 2016.",73.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay

"Sure, it starts out a bit toasty and cedary, but that wood will surely integrate with the potent plummy, meaty fruit given a few years' time.

"Very ripe and concentrated, this wine offers fruit-forward peach and pear flavors. There is also a hint of mango, and a sense of toastiness and smooth texture, although the acidity is never far away. Give the wine another year to mature.",43.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc

"Big, rich and rounded, this is as much a wine about sweet tropical fruits as about spiciness. It has weight, concentration and a full, honeyed character. For the wine to fully integrate, it should be aged over 3–4 years.",33.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer

All this is tempered by a tight, mineral texture that gives the wine a fine final bite. Drink from 2017.",59.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"The nose is shy but the palate is an enticing, delicious clash of honeyed, sweet richness—think blossom honey and dripping caramel, with the tart lurid freshness of lemon oil. This is alive and enlivening in its contrast and moreishness. The finish is lip-smacking and long, holding secrets of honeyed apricots and pears.",135.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"The aromatics take time to come to the fore but they are definitely there: notes of lifted Poire William and ripe, golden-cheeked apricots are hinted at. The medium-sweet palate brings them out in full force, glowing with a ripe opulence tempered by freshness and a slight phenolic grip. There is a luminous quality to this wine, shining its way ahead into the future, guided by a seam of freshness and focus on the midpalate, echoing with bitter almond and more fruit. Drink 2016–2026.",90.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"Soft, gentle fruit of stewed apple shimmers on the nose but on the palate is contained by immense, lemony zestiness. There is real muscle and elegance.

Drink 2018–2030.",34.00,Alsace,Riesling

Drink 2016–2030.",72.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"Subtle notions of ripe peach circle above a compact, bundled palate of peach and spice: perhaps vanilla, perhaps pepper. The distinct but subtle sweetness on the palate is countered by a firm, focussed freshness which in turn contrasts with pleasant warmth. The dramatic palate draws you so far into its quicksand-like depth that you almost forget to notice the more ethereal, scented clouds of peach. Pure joy.",65.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer

Drink from 2022.",307.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir

A wine that is alive through and through and still very primary. This is dry and slender and will develop. Drink 2016–2025.",43.00,Alsace,Riesling
"There is an undoubtedly fragrant but somehow veiled nose of dried orange peel. The palate opens up fully into the comforting aromas of baked Bramley apples, highlighted by lots of lemon freshness.

"Notes of beeswax, mirabelle plum compote and faint cardamom spice suggest a wine no longer in the first flush of youth. This is a compounded, rich but dry, layered but ultraclean wine.

This has lots of substance.",50.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer

"This blend of 55% Cabernet Sauvignon and 45% Merlot is initially firm with dry tannins and a powerful structure.

"That this wine is all Merlot is the reason both for its jammy richness and its high alcohol. It gives a wine that is out of balance, with pepper, spice and wood dominating the super-ripe black cherry fruits. It's unlikely to age for long.",16.00,Bordeaux,Merlot

"While wood aging is an integral part of fine Bordeaux, with this wine it is just too much. While it is young, the wood, raw and dominant, submerges the fruit to give a wine that is dense, very dry and hard at the edges. It's not likely to ever lose this quality.",26.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend

"Rounded notes of Bosc pear flesh and peel play softly on nose and palate. There is a very pleasant, slightly bitter phenolic edge, reminiscent of marzipan and a slight sweetness.

Two bottles tasted.",115.00,Southwest_France,Tannat

"Young, very crisp wine, definitely in the bright acidity style of sparkling wine, its fruits going towards currants, with a final grapefruit citrus element. It does need a few more months' bottle age to lose its complete emphasis on acidity.",18.00,Loire_Valley,Sparkling_Blend

"A light pink/grey color on a wine that is equally light on flavor, feeling rather neutral. The acidity is attractive, but the fruit is limited.",22.00,Provence,Rosé

There is a slight edge of astringency, but then the smoky wood and berry flavors kick back in.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Yes, it has 2003 ripeness, but there is also some restraint here. The tannins are still defiantly young, the fruit packed with black plum jelly flavors. It promises 2–3 years' aging.",40.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend

The tingling mouth, loaded with acidity and moderate carbonation, delights with flavors of strawberry hull and clementine supremes. An excellent choice for the next time you're looking to celebrate, or just treat yourself.",17.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Sparkling_Blend

It's medium bodied, with supple tannins and a long, fruit-driven finish. Drink now–2016.",26.00,Rhône_Valley,G-S-M
"A full wine, with soft, ripe, green plum and elderflower flavors. It has a spicy edge to it, almost a feeling of ground pepper. The acidity lends the shape.",12.00,Provence,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"In its bottle reminiscent of an old-style gin bottle, this is certainly a stand-out in terms of appearance. The wine is less interesting, pale in color, fat in style.",22.00,Provence,Rosé
"With only 795 bottles produced, this is a special treat. Although it's ready to drink now, it has the structure and pedigree to age for decades. Loaded with rich nut and rancio flavors, there's so much going on; aromas of dried orange peel, gingerbread, toasted macadamia nut and a drizzle of molasses lead into flavors of dried red plum and fig dusted with Nutella powder and soft white pepper. Complex, spicy and full, with an endless finish.",380.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Red_Blend

"This medium- to full-bodied blend of 55% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 15% Mourvèdre is round in the mouth without being soft, and delivers a complex swirl of cherry, olive and herb flavors. It even picks up a bit of chocolate on the surprisingly long finish. Drink now–2015.",15.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This tastes light and fruity. Its great swathe of acidity cuts through the orange and red fruit flavors, lending crispness and a fresh finish.",19.00,Provence,Rosé

"For any serious fan of Rivesaltes, this is a must-have example. Aromas of dried apricot, toasted hazelnut, fig, ginger, sweet spice and candied orange rind fill the bouquet, while the mouth is silky and balanced—sweet and heady without being cloying. All of the aromas transition onto the palate alongside accents of walnut skins and shiitake mushroom. Soft salinity makes the long finish even more mouthwatering. Drink now, or continue to age. There are 869 bottles produced.",350.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Red_Blend

"A gorgeous wine, dark and complex, with assertive leather and licorice spice throughout the boysenberry and bramble character. Touches of graham cracker, tobacco leaf and spice unfold in the mouth. Lush and decadent, with a lingering chocolate-raspberry finish. Enjoyable now, it could show more balance and finesse in 2–3 years.",75.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"The fact that this wine comes from the chalkiest of soils and is bone dry gives it considerable austerity. It is definitely mineral in taste and texture, with a touch of salt and grapefruit flavors;  very structured and tight. It needs to age.",60.00,Champagne,Chardonnay

"Made in a traditional style with no evident new oak, leathery, meaty notes balance dusty earth and sour plums on the nose, while the palate is full, round and richly textured. Finishes with dark, savory notes of coffee and black olives. Drink now–2017.",17.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"The cherry, leather and chocolate aromas are accompanied by a slightly citrusy aroma in this blend of 65% Grenache, 20% Syrah, 10% Carignan and 5% Cinsault. It's creamy, warm and inviting on the palate, with black cherry and plum fruit, before turning chocolaty on the long finish. Drink now.",13.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
The Jaume family's négociant business is thriving because of wines like this that faithfully represent their terroirs while offering solid value. This raspberry- and garrigue-scented wine features ample weight framed by supple tannins that firm up on the finish. Drink now–2018.,27.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Full, soft and rounded, this shows flavors of ripe strawberry and red plum. The texture is smooth, with just a tang of minerality. Nutmeg and pepper complement the acidity on the finish.",35.00,Provence,Rosé
"With its firm, black fruits, this is a very chunky wine, mineral in character. It has tension, with tannins layered with intense flavors, very structured. It needs aging. One of a series of single-vineyard wines created by Jean-Luc Baldès.",30.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"Made using an adaptation of a Cahors tradition of warming the must before fermentation to increase stability as well as color. Immensely powerful tannins, chocolate density, with a youthful bitter edge at this stage.",60.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"With just shy of 1,000 bottles produced, this will be hard to find. Dried fruit flavors of raspberry and red plum dominate the nose and mouth, while notes of sweet mulled spice, clove-pricked orange rind, pepper, walnut skin and bittersweet cocoa glimmer throughout. Full and rich but lively, with medium acidity and a zippiness to the finish. Enjoyable now, but this will benefit from another 5–10 years in the cellar.",300.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Red_Blend
"Toasty aromas are followed by intense black plum fruits twisted with tannins and polished with wood. It's an impressive, powerful wine, with a complex structure. Firm at this stage, it need 4¬–5 years at least to age.",22.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"With its highly mineral aroma, this is almost like smelling chalk. It's an austere wine, with high acidity, crystal clear on the palate, full of grapefruit flavors and flint texture. Age this wine at least 4 years.",50.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"An enticing, sophisticated wine. While it is fresh, with great floral aromas and flavors, it also shows hints of maturity, with toast just beginning to float over the yeast and grapefruit flavors. The aftertaste is very dry, crisp.",46.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Wood maturation gives this wine roundness, despite its dryness. At the moment, it is too young, very vigorous, and touched by caramel. The feeling is of a weighty, structured wine, even though the aftertaste is fresh.",90.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"A Brotte-owned estate, Domaine Grosset shows that when the family puts their heart into doing the best they can, their efforts are rewarded. It's rich and spicy, with cola and plum aromas and flavors that are dense and almost fruitcake-like, finishing with hints of coffee and plum. Drink now-2015.",20.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A full-bodied wine, with aromas of apples and pears. It's dry, lively and fresh, with great crisp fruit, flavors of grapefruits, and long-lasting acidity. It needs two years to develop.",16.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Some yeasty aromas lead to a young-tasting, fresh wine, dominated by pure floral notes and crisp acidity. A great apéritif wine. Imported by Cellar Door Selections.",30.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A very fruity wine with toast and maturity. It also has a creamy texture, but the finish is spoiled by some unbalanced sweetness. Imported by Moët Hennessy USA.",70.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"A pretty salmon-pink-colored wine, which is soft and dominated by easy flavors of pink grapefruit and crisp acidity. This is fresh, and fine as an apéritif. Imported by Grape Expectations of Georgia.",46.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Light in color and texture, this is a wine that reflects the lightweight red wine vintage. But it is balanced, with good spice and enough sweet fruit to fit with the acidity. Drink now.",21.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"Initially this is round, ripe and floral, with a touch of honey, but then the acidity comes through with a touch of minerality. Screwcap.",13.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Soft and rounded, this has apple and peach fruits, with a lemon zest texture. The acidity is a refreshing counterweight to the smooth character.",20.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"From the second terrace level above the river Lot, this is a powerful as well as elegant single vineyard wine. It's touched by bitter fruits, along with great acidity and a depth of tannins.",30.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"The name of the wine obviously comes from the Catholic mass, but it's also inspired by the ancient origins of the Cahors vineyards. The wine itself is smooth, polished and mint flavored, the tannins ripe and juicy. Wood rounds out the natural Malbec tannins.",20.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"Well balanced, bringing together its firm, youthful tannins with ripe jammy fruits and  great swathes of spice and chocolate. It needs aging, but it is an impressive wine.",30.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"While it certainly is tannic, the wine also has bold fruit, full of black berry and sweet jam flavors. That makes this balanced, although when the tannins are going to soften is unsure. Decant before serving.",22.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"It's only medium bodied, but this wine displays charming notes of wild herbs that make it irresistible. The floral and herbal notes wrap seamlessly around the core of ripe cherry fruit, which picks up a touch of chocolaty richness on the finish. Drink now–2014.",14.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Full in the mouth, this is a rich style of rosé, with delicious red-berry crispness. It is ready for food with its tangy, textured aftertaste. Screwcap.",20.00,Provence,Rosé
"Ripe, smooth and toasty, this has the feel and texture of Chardonnay. It is full and rounded, yet its acidity and red fruit character lend elegance.",70.00,Provence,Rosé
"Crisp, dry but fruity, this has just enough body to support the red currant flavors and crisp red-apple skin texture. A lively, vibrant wine, all freshness and light, just what a rosé should be.",40.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is part of a range which returns to origins, with wood fermentation for the wines. Perfumed, green initially and then showing flavors of lychees and earthiness, this has some oak toast, but more of an open flavor from light (and pleasing) oxidation.",80.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Still very young, this wine needs time to develop its intense minerality. Now it is more about grapefruit and yeast, although it is also full-bodied, a sign of the 1999 vintage. Wait five years at least.",106.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"With its yeasty aromas and fresh, crisp acidity, this is a young-tasting Champagne. There are flavors of green apples, just a hint of toast and a dry aftertaste from the low dosage.",58.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Are delicate and full-bodied contradictions? Not here, with this ripe, red-fruit-flavored wine, which still creeps delicately around the palate. From its just pink color to its soft, yet still crisp aftertaste, this is a well-balanced wine, which could probably age well for 2–3 years.",300.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is half barrel-fermented, and it shows in the wine's scents of toast, but there's plenty of fruit to back that up. Honeysuckle, peach and melon aromas and flavors round out the palate, finishing with hints of peppery spice. Drink now.",50.00,Rhône_Valley,Viognier
"A piercingly steely wine, all angles and acidity. That said, there's a greater depth of flavor that needs time to come out—the richness of the green fruit is there, as is the hint of wood. The corners need to soften for a year or so.",33.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Despite the different branding, this is a selection from the family's Domaine Barville in Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Dusty scents of dried spices and red plums turn ripe and creamy in the mouth, layering in black cherry and plum flavors. Finishes lush and long, a modern-styled wine that may be consumed young.",43.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Rich, full and spiced with generous wood, this is deliciously fat Meursault. Almost honeyed in flavor and given backbone by some minerality; there's good ripeness here. An almost opulent wine.",64.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"There's good concentration with this wine. It shows green apples, pears and green plum skin flavors. On top, there is wood, well balanced with the fruit; a sumptuous mix that shows the generosity of 2005.",26.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"“Fullness and goodness” is a rough translation of the name of this wine. It's an accurate description of its richness. There is great spice, bolstering the full fruit, showing a mineral, chalky structure along with fresh green fruits.",30.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A full, creamy wine with a big mousse that fills the mouth. The fruit is more restrained, but the structure firm. This bottling was too young when tasted—another year of aging would have been an improvement. Imported by Laurent-Perrier.",34.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A very soft, creamy rosé that has yeast and toast characters. It is less dry than some, but it does show some acidity to finish. A pleasant wine, with easy fruit. Imported by Moët Hennessy USA.",40.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Salmon to onion-skin pink in color, this is a rosé with a relatively high level of dosage and a soft finish. There are red fruits, but also nuts and a citrus kick on the finish. A very smooth Champagne. Imported by Allied Domecq Wines USA.",76.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"An attractive, salmon-pink-colored wine, which has flavors of ripe strawberries and a touch of caramel. The acidity is relatively light, and the impression is of a ripe wine. Imported by Cellar Door Selections.",40.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"The famous yellow label wine. This bottling contains mostly 2001-vintage base wine, and offers a round mouthfeel balanced by crisp acids and flavors of apple and citrus.",50.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is a very pure wine, bone dry and with fine citric flavors. It's fresh and crisp, but there is also great intensity of flavor, with acidity and white fruit flavors. The aftertaste is clean and very refreshing.",18.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Unlike the candied aromas exhibited by some Beaujolais, this boasts a seriously vinous nose, with cherries and herbs and a hint of smoke or rock dust. To further distinguish it from ordinary Beaujolais, it's fairly full-bodied and shows tea-like tannins on the finish.",18.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"For a Beaujolais-Villages, there are surprisingly firm tannins here, but the vibrant fruit seems equal to them. There is freshness, with a bright cherry aftertaste.",14.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"Ripe and full bodied, this is a wine that reflects the softness of the vintage. Aged in wood, it has a rounded texture, with spice, apricot and pineapple flavors, finishing with a touch of acidity.",30.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is structured, with tannins and dark fruits that are balanced by bright acids. The firm, dry tannins give the wine shape; it will ultimately develop into a round, rich Pinot Noir.",90.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This is a very minerally wine with a fine, steely, taut character. It offers notes of fresh-cut apple and citrus juice, with a lively, bright finish.",27.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Soft and ripe, this has the richness of ripe apples and pears, but is lightened with bright acidity. There's a great tang of lemon to lift the wine into crispness while remaining richly textured.",32.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is dry and spicy, with a full character. Perfumed and rich, it's concentrated and packed with wild strawberry fruit. It finishes with intense acidity.",16.00,Provence,Rosé
"This is a delightful rosé that's full of lemon and raspberry fruit. The lively, crisp acidity should cut through rich fare.",15.00,Provence,Rosé
"This is a soft, carmel-flavored wine, with smooth yeast and sweet fruit flavors. The richness is balanced with apple skin acidity and a crisp, clean aftertaste.",32.00,Provence,Rosé
"From selected parcels at Sainte-Roseline, this is a concentrated and serious rosé. It has weight and rich strawberry fruit, balanced by attractive acidity. The aftertaste brings in ripe fruit and a touch of spice.",38.00,Provence,Rosé
"Medium bodied and firmly structured, this doesn't show the generosity of the 2009 vintage as much as some other Nothern Rhônes. Instead, it's a traditionally built wine with classic notes of smoke, herbs and black olives, and even some ash-like notes on the finish. Drink 2013–2018.",30.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"An early-maturing Crozes-Hermitage, with aromas of violets and hickory smoke alongside charming blueberry and blackberry fruit. There's not much tannin in this medium-bodied wine, so drink it over the next couple of years for its easy charm.",27.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Herb and strawberry flavors shine through this rich, southern-feeling wine. It is ripe and smooth, with a bright, lively aftertaste.",15.00,Provence,Rosé
"From grand cru vines in Avize, Oger, Cramant and Oiry, this is full and intensely flavored, with very crisp apple and white pear flavors. To finish, the wine rounds out with vanilla and smooth textures.",50.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"This emblematic cuvée from Mumm (known for many years as Crémant de Cramant because it was bottled at a slightly lower pressure) is a celebration of grand cru Chardonnay in Cramant. It is a finely structured, relatively full-bodied wine, showing toast and butter flavors along with the pink grapefruit and crisp apple tastes.",60.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
Showing signs of toasty maturity. Rosé Champagne does age but it becomes much more like regular (white) Champagne. There are only just hints of red fruits as a reminder of its youthful character. The wine though remains delicious.,80.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A dense wine, tannic and firmly structured. It's one of those wines that are not for the faint-hearted with its power, concentration and medicinal character. Age for several years.",40.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"A smooth wine, the tannins suspended within a velvet texture, resulting in an opulent, rich feel. This is very intense, with medicinal and dark plum skin flavors. Powerful, solid, for aging.",18.00,Southwest_France,Malbec-Merlot
"Hay, nutmeg and sourdough are aromatic partners to the toasty char and cheese flavors. Although a bit frothy, the flinty acidity and dry finish leave the palate clean and refreshed. This is young, mainstream and tasty.",25.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"The vintage Moët seems a bit sugary, with broad, simple flavors. It's a blocky wine; a bit of citrus here, some butterscotch there, and that sugary kick to the finish. Just a bit too paint-by-the-numbers.",53.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Salty, even briny scents dominate, along with a slightly resinous character. In the mouth this is a flavorful, rather heavy wine which carries its weight and power in the dead center of the palate. Nothing elegant here, but it's a good mouthful of fruit, finishing with an herbal-metallic note.",21.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This big, friendly wine shows ripe, forward scents of mixed citrus and light tropical fruits, along with toasted nuts. Medium-rich and already showing some aged, slightly oxidized character, it is definitely built for near-term drinking.",35.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is a crisp, bracing bubbly, with tight fruit tasting of green apples, outlined in lightly defined toast. Iron and mineral dominate the precise finish.",12.00,Burgundy,Champagne_Blend
"The dosage level is 45g/l, which makes this wine a bit sweet, but not cloying. Toast and candied citron aromas and some honeyed apple and lemon flavors. Decanting reduces the apparent acidity, thereby raising the perception of sweetness.",50.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Strong currant aromas, soft in texture with hints of caramel and toast as well as a more steely texture. The wine is fresh, light, deliciously ready to drink. Screwcap.",20.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A wine that has just the right balance between acidity and fruit. It's smooth and soft, with an attractive zesty texture. The wine has warm richness on the finish.",25.00,Provence,Rosé
"A blend of 50% Grenache, 40% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre, this is full bodied and richly textured, redolent of wild thyme and lavender, black cherries and a hint of cocoa. Drink this charmer over the next couple of years.",12.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A rounded style, with full-bodied red fruits and a rich, silky texture. The wine still does have attractive acidity and a crisp grapefruit edge to balance it out.",45.00,Provence,Rosé
"Very intense, very nervy wine, living on a thin wire of grapefruit and other citrus flavors but much more about pure structure. The aftertaste shows great concentration.",100.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"This is full, perhaps heavy, but certainly with a fine, powerful character. The acidity and the green-apple texture are at one with the white-fruit flavors, which gives extra richness to the wine. Just a hint of mineral can be detected.",400.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Toasty, floral and full-bodied, with a soft aftertaste, this has a great aromatic swathe initially, with only hints of Chardonnay minerality. The wine is delicious, with ripe white fruits and light acidity to finish.",65.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Big, ripe, juicy wine, threaded by tannins. It has an elegant structure, with bright black berry fruits to go with the layers of smoky wood and tannins. Age for 3-4 years.",18.00,Southwest_France,Malbec-Merlot
"This  comes from the 88-acre Domaine des Deux Roches. Big and rich, but freshened with great acidity. The fruits are green, given a tightness by minerality and wood. Drink this summer with freshly-caught trout by the camp fire.",20.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"From one of the family's own estates, this is a fine effort. Rich flavors of pie cherries and a bit of dried spice glide easily across the palate, cushioned by soft, plush tannins. Drink now-2012.",20.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Pineapple and other tropical fruit flavors, plus a little custard, play on the palate; they're there, but not all intense.  Lively in the mouth and on the medium finish, where tart citrus and slate notes keep the fruitiness in check.  Bouquet shows mineral, orange peel and starchy, white-rice aromas.",27.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Is that breakfast in the nose?  The scrambled eggs and toast aromas leave you asking for the bacon and coffee.  this bubbly is bulky and full-bodied, with a sugary center of ripe red apple and pear.  Good in a simple way, but not exciting.",34.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Bizarre is the best way to describe this kosher offering: The nose is fragrant, with bright ripe fruit backed by cotton-candy and algae-ish notes.  Apple, charcoal and pear are tinged with a slight greenness on the palate; mouthful is medium-full, but a bit too effervescent and frothy. Finishes long.",40.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This rather full and slightly fruity offering shows attractive plum and berry aromas and flavors.  The mouthfeel, though, is quite soft, verging on mushy, without an acid backbone to provide definition to the flavors and life to the palate feel.  Has a touch of class and a decent length; deserves a spine.",45.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A blend of sweetness and tangy citrus flavors form the core of this wine, with apple and pear notes at the fringes.  The finish is long, though a bit cloying.",35.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"From organic grapes, this is a soft, red-fruited wine. The tang of acidity is well balanced by the full fruit character. It's ripe and attractively structured.",22.00,Provence,Rosé
"Mordorée's Côtes du Rhône is a classic blend built around 40% Grenache and 30% Syrah, with smaller amounts of the other permitted varieties. The result combines scents of leather and roasted meat with cherries and dark overtones of cocoa and coffee. It's a nicely balanced, full-bodied wine, with just a touch of coarseness to its texture. Drink now-2016.",19.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Big and rounded, this has layers of caramel and strawberry flavors. The fruit is ripe and forward, with delicious acidity and a soft, honeyed aftertaste.",23.00,Provence,Rosé
"This wine is beginning to get some age to it, but remains fresh. There is some toast, even coffee, while the aftertaste is soft and slightly candied.",48.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"This is a heavy, rather clumsy wine, that seems to be too soft. The weight shows through the almonds and green plum fruits, while the acidity seems somewhat forced. To finish, the softness returns. Bottle age may help this wine to liven up.",140.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"The softness of the 1999 vintage is very apparent in this approachable wine. It is full, round, only just touched by minerality, white fruits and some almonds giving weight and character.",62.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"A good wine, this is a young, aromatic Chardonnay with lively white fruits bursting from the acidity.",40.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"A big, bold wine with fine acidity and firm dark black tannins. It has proper weight, richness as well as a big structure. The core is dense, mineral, tight. Drink now, but could age for several years.",17.00,Southwest_France,Tannat
"Mainly from the lieu dit vineyard of Crotot, this is powerful, rounded in the way that Meursault should be. The fruit is ripe, filling the mouth with apples and cream flavors, topped by understated wood.",22.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Muscular, powering its way with richness and structured tannins. The white pear and almond flavors seem to sit on top of this dense wine, which will need to age. It reflects the super-rich side of white Burgundy in 2005.",50.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A limited production wine from Labouré-Roi's own vineyards, this is powerful and ripe, but tempered with refreshing acidity. With its spice and ginger flavors, it rolls richly around the mouth, and then finishes crisp and fresh.",48.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This soft and slightly green sparkler has redeeming mild spice notes.  The bouquet's hint of anise and tarragon add interest, and the even, smooth palate shows more licorice notes and even light feel with a soft mousse.  Green herbs show on the finish of this easy drinker.",9.00,France_Other,Champagne_Blend
"At first, the bouquet reads like bread dusted with powdered sugar; after a few minutes in the glass, the nose takes on burnt-sugar and caramel notes.  in the mouth, it's soft, effervescent and on the sweet side: Flavors of white peach, chalk (and that powdered-sugar note again) are most prominent.  Finishes short to medium, with sugar and a citrus tang.  It's not terribly complex, but it will have wide appeal; there's not much tang or tautness, and will go down easy.",27.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A floral nose and a very soft mouthfeel characterize this easy bubbly.  With somewhat sweet, flowery flavors, it's really a demi-sec, and will have wide appeal.  Finishes modestly and a little drier than the palate.  It's a touch simple but makes no pretense, and is a decent inexpensive pour.",11.00,France_Other,Sparkling_Blend
"Clean, simple, fresh and very pink.  Don't analyze this wine too much; it's a somewhat sweet bubbly that's made to please the masses.  Melon and peach flavors come with a forceful bead.  Pink grapefruit is the dominant flavor.  Pleasant enough for cocktail parties.",31.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Attractive, mild floral and white-pepper aromas and flavors show in this even, light sparkler, but a weird element somewhere between underripe vegetables and a chemical note detracts considerably.  It's soft on the palate and closes with modest length, the good and bad elements struggling for the upper hand on the finish.",9.00,France_Other,Champagne_Blend
Volatile at first and clumsy throughout.  The bouquet is rather odd and mildly offputting.  Apple sauce and lemon flavors dominate what could best be described as off-center Champagne.  The millenium is over and-- frankly speaking-- so are the glory days of this over-priced wine.,50.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Opens with a stunning layered, bouquet of dried fruits, sandalwood, flowers, smoke and ginger. It's full on the tongue, with rich pear and apple flavors, toast and yeast accents. Citrus and mineral notes persist on the lengthy finish of this impressively complex bottling. Sourced from seven grand cru villages, this is superb now and will last a very long time.",185.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is a classic white Bordeaux blend, half Sauvignon Blanc, half Sémillon. It enjoys the freshness of 2006, lifted pink grapefruit and citrus flavors, rounded with some wood, and freshened with delicious kiwi fruits.",9.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"The lightest pink in color, this delicacy translates into the pure Chardonnay of the Champagne itself which has Pinot Noir added to give color and just a touch of red-fruit flavors.",60.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Good, mineral and grass, fresh wine, full of herbaceous Sauvignon Blanc and young Sémillon. It's deliciously brushed by wood.",12.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"An elegant, full-bodied wine, showing the richness of 2005, but keeping the tropical fruit element in balance with the light toast and butter flavors. The acidity is harder to find, but it comes through with spice in a soft aftertaste.",14.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"This isn't the most complex Côtes du Rhône, but it does offer bold, fruit-driven flavors of cherry and raspberry, medium body and tannins that are creamy soft. Drink this 50-50 blend of Grenache and Syrah over the next year or so.",11.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Aged predominantly in concrete tanks, this treatment allows the fruit to speak loudly and clearly, delivering dark cherry flavors tinged with dried herbs. It's creamy in texture, with ample acids on the finish to help balance the rich tannins. Drink now–2018.",17.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Fruity and ripe, this has rich red fruits and a smooth texture, with blended acidity. Its concentrated, with a piquant edge of pepper from the alcohol.",20.00,Provence,Rosé
"Unlike most Côtes du Rhônes, this one is based on Syrah, with only a small proportion of Grenache used in the blend. The result is a slightly less weighty, spicier wine than typical for the appellation, but one that remains round on the palate, with cherries and silky tannins lingering on the finish. Drink it over the next few years.",12.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This 100% Chenin Blanc is a beautiful exaple of what the variety can express: soft florals loaded with garrigue notes alongside tropical fruit aromas of mango, guava and pineapple. It's vibrant in the mouth, with moderate acidity and a lifting backbone of lemon verbena. The finish lingers gracefully, and overall the wine is ripe and attractive without being sweet or cloying.",20.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chenin_Blanc
"Named after the dry wind that blows through the Jurançon vineyards, this light, poised sweet wine has typical freshness, the botrytis never cloying but immersed in currants, fresh apricots. The wine has a lively, buoyant, sweet character.",24.00,Southwest_France,White_Blend
"Super-ripe, and powerful, with an edge of new wood, but mainly dominated by apricots and rich white fruits. It's big and ripe, just keeping on the right side of blowsy.",50.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A delicious green and white fruit-flavored wine, spiced up by some new wood, rounded out with cream and then sharpened with acidity. Ready to drink, but could age for 2 years.",36.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Ripe but minerally, all flint and crisp fruit along with the richness from the structure and green plum and wood flavors. This blending of fruit from a number of Chablis Premier Cru vineyards shows the rich, ageworthy nature of 2005.",29.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Full, rich, quite heavy in style, this is only just brut, with its crushed strawberry flavor and low acidity. It works, as a fine wine for a red-fruit dessert, the balance remaining right up to the very soft aftertaste.",80.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"More toast than fruit even at this young stage, this is a ripe wine, showing big woody, toasty flavors that leave freshness behind. There are flavors of cream, caramel and wood here. Acidity appears on the finish.",75.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Classic black-colored Malbec, very perfumed, its fruit polished by smooth tannins. On the palate, black damson and bitter chocolate flavors are present. It's a powerful wine, full of firm tannins, its dark edge softened by wood.",21.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"Loads of menthol and pepper spice fill the nose, with a supporting fruit core of black cherry, black currant and wild raspberry. The texture is like crushed satin but the tannins, though fine grain, have good staying power. Mocha and cherry pits add character to the close.",24.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Red_Blend
"Smooth yet crisp, this has attractive acidity and strawberry fruit. It is poised and elegant, with just the right amount of acidity.",11.00,Provence,Rosé
"Full bodied yet very supple, this borders on being fat but does offer attractive cranberry and herb aromas and immediate drinkability. Cranberry, cherry and spice notes mark the palate, lingering briefly on the finish. Drink now.",39.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"The Brotte version of the region's traditional dessert wine is a bit spirity, but fresh, with bold scents of chestnut blossom and orange rind and clean, marmalade-like flavors. Drink now.",40.00,Rhône_Valley,Muscat
"A fresh, strawberry-flavored wine, with good red berry and red apple-skin textures. The acidity is initially prominent, but then there is also a burst of candy, leaving softness.",60.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is a blend from seven of Pascal Agrapart's less important vineyards. It tastes as young as many of the vines are crisp with some citrus and fennel, but there is some softness. Not for aging.",45.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Soft butter and vanilla-almond milk mingle with pear and Gala apple aromas and flavors. Accents of thyme and orange blossom add complexity to the bouquet, while woody sweet spice appears in the mouth and sticks around through the long close. Full, creamy and decadent. Only 5,200 bottles produced.",75.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"The blend in this cuvée is 70% Grenache and 30% Syrah, aged in second-use oak. The oak provides hints of baking spices on the nose and some cedary notes on the palate, nicely accenting the bright black-cherry fruit in this medium-bodied wine. Soft tannins combine with mouthwatering acids on the finish. Drink now–2016.",22.00,Rhône_Valley,Grenache-Syrah
"This is a round, silky Châteauneuf-du-Pape that's an appealing, early-drinking rendering. Cherry and leather notes aren't particularly complex beyond a certain horsiness, but the wine fills the mouth and the flavors do linger.",37.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Despite this wine's evident ripeness, it remains freshly floral and perfumed on the nose. On the palate, it delivers ripe black-cherry fruit and hints of chocolate and licorice, cushioned by a lush, velvety texture. Drink it over the next year or two.",13.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A tight, very mineral wine, with crisp acidity, firm fruit flavors and just hinting at caramel and vanilla. This is  still young, hiding behind its structure. Give it 3–4 years.",25.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Toasty, with notes of slightly menthol-like oak layered over ripe blackberry fruit. It's a medium-bodied wine that finishes crisp, tart and mouthwatering. Give it another 6–12 months to better integrate the oak, then drink it over the next five or so years.",16.00,Southwest_France,Malbec-Merlot
"Full-bodied and ripe, with cool green fruits topping some rich vanilla, cream and white currant flavors. It's certainly very fruity, but there's an extra dimension of a youthful structure that needs another year to develop fully.",23.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Produced from a Brotte-owned property, this Châteauneuf is a deliberate counterpoint to the Père Anselme bottling. It sees some new oak, giving it a slightly toasty character to go with dried cherries, prune and baking spices. Firm on the finish; try after 2008.",40.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A soft, simple and fresh wine, with light fruit and some good acidity. It has flavors of apples which leave a good clean aftertaste.",11.00,Alsace,Riesling
"This attractively priced Gigondas is a solid example, boasting traditional notes of leather and spiced meat. It's supple and slightly warm, with modest cherry fruit coated with a dusting of dry red earth. Clove and metallic notes on the finish suggest early consumption is the prudent option.",22.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This is a bright, soft wine, rounded and finely balanced. The delicate apple- and pear-skin flavors bring out the acidity and lift the smooth texture.",24.00,Provence,Rosé
"This is a very drinkable Gigondas despite being very much in the savory-spicy style. Leather, garrigue, cinnamon and clove are the dominant notes, softened by silky tannins and modest cherry fruit. Drink now–2015.",26.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Plan de Dieu is an oft-overlooked commune within the Côtes du Rhône Villages that frequently produces very ripe wines. This one is chocolaty and chunky in style, with intense notes of black cherries and some extracted, bitter notes of coffee and cocoa on the finish. Drink it over the next few years with heaty stews or braises.",16.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Composed of 85% Syrah, 10% Grenache and 5% Mourvèdre and aged in almost exclusively new oak for eight months, this is an opulent wine loaded with dark cherry and raspberry, mocha and garrigue spice throughout. It's full and lush but balanced and well integrated. Drinks beautifully now but should hold for another couple of years.",20.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A strawberry-fruited wine, with a pink sunset color and light, very fresh fruit. The aftertaste is soft and gentle.",43.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is fresh and herbal, with crisp flavors of red fruit and citrus. It's made from old vines close to Mont Sainte-Victoire in the heart of Provence.",16.00,Provence,Rosé

Cherry and plum notes are dressed up with hints of wild thyme and cracked pepper, while some cocoa-like textures and flavors linger on the finish. Drink now.",11.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend

"This is a concentrated wine that's full of black fruits and textured tannins. It has spice, rosemary and a taut character.",18.00,Provence,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Attractive, ripe and full-bodied, this is touched with spice, vanilla and fresh pear flavors. This is an excellent example of white Burgundy: no complexity, just pleasure.",17.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Lifted cracked pepper and cherry scents on the nose are rounded a bit on the palate by hints of caramelly oak, but this is still a good representation of northern Rhône Syrah, finishing dry and peppery.",25.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This is ripe and soft, with its red fruits well integrated into the rounded texture. There is a crisp edge to the wine, with spice, lemon and apple skin flavors.",30.00,Provence,Rosé

"Soft barnyard mingles with dried thyme and lavender, adding complexity to the juicy plum, cherry and wild raspberry flavors. Creamy but firm, with gripping tannins and a cocoa-dusted finish. With 50% Syrah, 40% Grenache and 10% Carignan, this is an intense Minervois that can stand up to beef stew or braised short ribs.",18.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Fresh, crisp, green apple and white pear fruit flavors are given extra richness by kiwi. There's structure to this wine, but it's mainly simple, open and generous.",17.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Fading and a bit oxidized, this is past its prime.",10.00,Alsace,White_Blend
"The ultimate in SGN wines, because it not only has richness, sweetness, and botrytis, but it also offers acidity, balance and total seduction. There are flavors of peaches and mirabelles, but they are really all submerged in the amazing elegance of a wine that will age indefinitely.",269.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"Lightly perfumed, this white Bordeaux shows the fresh character of the 2006 vintage. The acidity is poised, lifted and goes well with the pink grapefruit flavors. Drink this summer.",10.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"A creamy textured wine, with fresh green apples, herbs, pink grapefruit and a fresh, crisp zing. It is full-bodied, intense and packed with fruit.",10.00,Bordeaux,Sauvignon_Blanc

"Attractive and enticing, with aromas of dried red fruit and raspberry dust spiced up with notes of pepper, cocoa and toffee. Although grippy and somewhat sandpapery in the mouth, that firm texture lingers through the endless finish. Still young; try in 2012.",24.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Red_Blend
"A full and ripe wine that expresses the great 2005 vintage well. It is showing mature signs, with hints of dried fruits, raisins and spice over wood. The texture is dense, smooth, the layer of tannin blending well with the mature fruit.",20.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The nose is loaded with garrigue aromas, mostly rosemary and dried bay leaf, lifted by vibrant black cherry and black berry jam. Licorice and spice unfold in the chewy mouth, with a decadent milk chocolate infused finish.",18.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Red_Blend
"With 25% new wood, this has good roundness, but it has kept a deliciously fresh mineral character. The aftertaste is all almonds, ripeness and vivid fruit flavors.",36.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is a wonderful wine, which comes from the vineyard in the south of Alsace that the Humbrechts brought back from obscurity. It has both intensity and also great elegance. It has flavors of currants, layers of orange zest and some fresh acidity. But it also has spice which lies gently with the fruit flavors. The taste just goes on forever.",102.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"A wine packed with noble rot, giving richness rather than sweetness. An intoxicating blend of smokiness and almonds mixes with flavors of citrus zest and toast in this complex, concentrated wine. From the tiny Huebuhl vineyard in Bergheim. Impressive. Imported by Lauber Imports.",47.00,Alsace,Alsace_white_blend
"It may be vendange tardive, but the sweetness is the least of this wine's qualities. It is more to do with how it relates to the terroir of the Heimbourg vineyard, with its mineral character, and its fine structure and texture. The fruit is still young, and would benefit from 5–10 years aging.",86.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"Smoky aromas followed by the explosion of sweet fruits, with flavors of ripe oranges, of wild flower honey and acidity. This is gorgeous now, but its sweetness should be tamed with aging. A fantastic wine.",214.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"Nicolas Joly and his mother are possessors of the smallest appellation in France: Coulée de Serrant. This almost vertical vineyard, dropping down to the Loire, facing due south, makes a mythical wine that is powerful and laden with exotic fruit flavors: oranges, lemon, apricots, accented with spices and the tannins of a youthful white wine. This will last for decades. Imported by Vintus.",79.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"This is one of the most powerful in the range of Zind-Humbrecht's extraordinary Gewürztraminers. It is packed with spice and pepper, and is rich, but dry. Its power comes from the sheer concentration of fruit. This is the sort of wine that needs to be drunk by itself—it will dominate any food.",87.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"The 12-acre Rotenberg vineyard in Wintzenheim produces vibrant, racy wines, like this blend of Riesling and Pinot Gris. It is fresh and intense, with concentrated flavors of sweet white currants. Imported by Lauber Imports.",47.00,Alsace,Alsace_white_blend
"A huge, opulent wine that oozes botrytis flavors, yet is not overtly sweet; it's a fine package of richness, dryness and sweetness. Balancing acidity shows through on the fresh finish.",68.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"That the greatest wine produced in the Baux-en-Provence region should be designated a vin de pays shows how meaningless French appellation law can be. The reason is that this singular wine, produced from rocky vineyards where nothing should reasonably grow, is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, which is not allowed under appellation rules. Forget the legality. Enjoy and admire the huge flavors of chocolate, spice, dark, brooding black fruits and lean tannins. This wine will age—give it 8 years. Imported by Jeroboam Wines.",50.00,Rhône_Valley,Cabernet_Sauvignon-Syrah
"Intensly rich without being sweet, this wine is full of ripe flavors and a touch of honey. It's a wonderful combination of spices, candied fruits and opulence. The acidity rounds this wine out nicely. Imported by Robert Chadderdon Selections.",75.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"An intensely sweet wine with layers of dry spice that give it balance. From the rich, fertile Goldert vineyard. This soil character gives it a richness and ripeness already, at this early stage in its development. Still the wine is structured and should age well over 10 years.",123.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"If you want to know what Muscat can really taste like, try this exotic, perfumed wine. Deiss conjures up flavors unusual in Alsace: violets, bergamot and pepper. Muscat is normally an apéritif, but this is more like a meal. Imported by Lauber Imports.",26.00,Alsace,Muscat
An attractive red-fruited wine that's light in flavor and texture. It's laced with acidity and a touch of vanilla. The finish is crisp and easy. Screwcap.,15.00,Provence,Rosé
"Citrus acidity and raspberry fruit combine in this ripe, sun-drenched wine. It has a fine balance of crispness, with rich fruits and a delicate lemon note on the finish.",23.00,Provence,Rosé
"Full bodied and richly tannic, this heavily extracted wine seems almost like too much of a good thing. Leather and cedar aromas give way to flavors of roasted meat, tapenade and asphalt and finish slightly warm. Maybe some time in the cellar will help dial this wine down.",34.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This is very fresh, with light acidity and a touch of caramel. Its round character is contrasted with tangerine crispness.",14.00,Provence,Rosé
"Bulky and rugged but sound, with some drying tannins on the finish. It compensates by offering attractive flavors of black cherries, black olives and hints of asphalt and garrigue. Try it with hearty braises or stews.",13.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend

"A ripe, full, intense wine with flavors of white currants, almonds and toast. Sings purity of fruit, with a light touch of softness at the end, balanced with intense acidity. Imported by Vintus.",29.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"A fine, poised wine, fresh and vibrant, which just demands to be drunk. Flavors of orange zest and white currants are balanced by layers of tannin and acidity. A delicious wine, packed with flavor. Imported by Lauber Imports.",47.00,Alsace,Alsace_white_blend
"A portion of the 111-acre Montirius vineyard is enclosed by ancient oak trees, which protect the vines from the searing winds of the Mistral normal in the Rhône valley. This gives the wine an intensity and density along with dark tannins. Concentrated black fruits have a powerful purity of flavor. Age for 5–10 years. Imported by Vintage '59 Imports.",25.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"An intense, sweet wine, this is packed full of orange flavors, citrus fruits and a touch of smokiness. A great wine, it's a delicious mix of fruits and mineral characters from the limestone soil of the Grasberg vineyard. Imported by Lauber Imports.",58.00,Alsace,Alsace_white_blend

"Orange marmalade aromas set the scene for a fresh, intensely sweet wine. It has rich flavors of tropical fruit and coconut, but the acidity still ensures that the wine is in balance.However, it will continue to develop. Try again in 2015.",123.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"A really green, grassy wine that owes a lot to New Zealand. It is fresh, crisp, squeaky clean and a great aperitif wine.",11.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Light, fresh, slightly grassy but more in the white fruit flavor profile. It's soft, with a citrus twang to it, great to drink as an apéritif, leaving a soft, creamy aftertaste.",10.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Perfumed yet rather rustic, this wine has aromatic white fruit flavors, touched with a yeasty, bready character. It's rounded, but misses on the freshness.",12.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Smooth and caramel-flavored, this has a feeling of weight and richness. Its texture is soft, with a tang of spice and peppered lemon zest. The name of the wine refers to the old trunk road that ran from Paris to Provence.",18.00,Provence,Rosé
"Séguret wines often have a firmness to their tannins, and this is no exception. Attractive notes of red cherries, dusty earth and garrigue are framed by starching tannins, which leave the finish spicy and drying. Drink it now with fatty red meats, or give it a couple of years in the cellar to mellow.",16.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A simple but attractive Côtes du Rhône, with impressively pure cherry-berry fruit, medium body and a slightly chunky feel. Drink it over the next couple of years.",15.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend

"Thick, attractive fruit flavors of black cherry, raspberry and blueberry welcome you in immediately, with supporting notes of bay leaf and minerality in the background.

"Has a touch of roasted character to the black cherry fruit, but the mouthfeel is pleasantly plump and creamy, and hints of black pepper perk up the finish.",16.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend

"Initially, this wine seems almost austere, with its lean acidity and tannic structure, which is surprising given Beblenheim's warm microclimate. It's rich, powerful and superconcentrated, but needs a good many years (give it 10+) of aging. Imported by Lauber Imports.",27.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"A full-bodied, rich, smoky, spicy wine with intense flavors of sweet lychees. A wine from the Burg vineyard in Bergheim, this shows ripe, white fruit flavors, silky tannins and concentration. Imported by Lauber Imports.",47.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"Bergheim is particularly noted for its Gewürztraminer, and it is not hard to see why with this concentrated, spicy example. The lychees and smoke aromas set the scene, and the flavors of spice, toast and exotic spices continue the story. It is relatively restrained at the moment, because it is young, but this will develop impressively over the next five years. Imported by Lauber Imports.",36.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"An attractively balanced wine, this is ripe but fresh. The raspberry and orange fruits are vivid and well etched into the structure of the wine.",14.00,Provence,Rosé
"This 95% Syrah wine (with 5% Grenache) is thick and hearty with a strong black fruit core augmented by nuances of flinty minerality, dark chocolate, tobacco and leather.

"A fine, fresh style of wine that wears its sweetness lightly and easily. It is crisp and full of baked apple flavors. There is delicious acidity that shines through. Unlike some of the more intense vendange tardive, this would work with savory foods.",86.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"Christine and Eric Saurel have 39 of their 111 acres in Gigondas. There they make a blend with Grenache and Mourvèdre. This 2002, from a difficult year in the Rhône, is impressively intense with flavors of ripe blackberries, of pepper and spice and huge, warm tannins. This will age well over 10 years.",30.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend

"The nose is gorgeous; the black plum and cherry fruit mingle seamlessly with licorice root, crushed violet and cocoa nib aromas. The tannins are so firm and assertive it almost kills your palate, with the fruit squeezing out on the end only after the astringency subsides. It shows promise, but needs a little more time to come together and smooth out.",15.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Red_Blend
"Baked red apple, soft peach and a touch of whole vanilla bean fill the bouquet, while notes of clementine rind and soft wood develop in the mouth. Round but not fat with medium acid and a solid finish. Drink now.",15.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay

"This has some freshness, with red-apple flavors, light and green. There's a spoiling touch of sulfur, probably the result of recent bottling.",20.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay

"Domaine Fond Croze's entry-level cuvée is a bit coarsely textured, but otherwise offers ample spice-driven flavors and a subtle layer of cherry fruit. Clove and pepper notes linger on the finish. Drink now–2015.",15.00,Rhône_Valley,Grenache-Syrah

"Like many of the Perrin & Fils wines, this one is firmly structured, its cherry and cocoa flavors ending on a dusty, tannic note.

"A big and bold blend of Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this brooding wine shows loads of black currant, plum, tobacco and menthol herbality on the nose and mouth. Anise and used coffee grinds develop on the close, which stays alongside the gripping tannins. Try after 2012.",15.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Red_Blend

"Fresh red-apple and nectarine slices abound on the nose and palate, while a lively floral character adds lift and depth to the bouquet. A touch of citrus pith and peach pit stay through the medium-length finish. Medium weight and fleshy, but vibrant and balanced.",14.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Viognier
"Mineral and stone flavors abound, with perfumed aromas and fruit totally textured by the terroir. White currant fruits are here, built around a firm core and piled with acidity. Will benefit from aging for several more years, but can be enjoyed now.",43.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Slightly more concentrated and structured than the Jaboulet's regular bottling of Crozes-Hermitage, the 2007 Nouvelère features fresh cherry and berry fruit admirably supported by hints of oak. It's medium to full in body, with soft tannins and a slightly dusty finish. Drink now–2020.",42.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah

"Full bodied, even a bit chunky in build, this 100% Syrah Côtes du Rhône features blueberry, vanilla and black olive aromas complemented by dense, slightly chewy fruit on the palate. Concentrated and long, if not terribly elegant; pair it with steak or roasts.",20.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah

"This Cairanne bottling is a solid addition to the Perrin family's operation, featuring slightly lifted aromas of crushed herbs, cracked pepper and ripe cherries. Flavors of cherries and dried spices fill the mouth, with just enough dusty tannins to provide structural integrity and modest longevity. Drink now–2017.",25.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend

The texture is round and fleshy, but a sweet spice and orange-oil lift help to keep the palate fresh and balanced.",15.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Viognier
"Typical for Tardieu-Laurent, this wine is strongly marked by its barrel treatment, which may be enough to put off traditionalists. But the quality and concentration levels of the black cherry fruit underneath are high, and this rather full-bodied, muscular Crozes should develop nicely over the next 5–7 years.",41.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Big. ripe and generous, showing some mineral character while also having concentrated apricot, peach and pineapple flavors, leavened with honey and layers of acidity. Like all fine Rieslings, this needs to age. Hold for at least four years.",20.00,Alsace,Riesling

"A luxury cuvée aged in oak for up to two years, this is marked by the barrel, but it's most intriguing feature is an intricate herbal overlay to the plummy fruit.

"A delicious example of Costières de Nîmes, this blend of 80% Syrah and 20% Grenache combines bright raspberry fruit with hints of garrigue for a taste experience that's notable for its complexity. The tannins are supple, while the long finish features hints of chocolate. The review is of the “white label” wine, but the importer claims the wine is identical to that under the Cuvée Elisabeth label.",12.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A smoothly rich wine, dry but rounded with tropical peach and apricot flavors that roll off the tongue. There's a smoky character, while the acidity only shows through in the aftertaste. Richness pervades throughout.",44.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"A wine with only natural sulfur, it feels lean, with piercing acidity and firm tannins. It is young and all the elements should fall into place, but with the fruit's stalky character the wine will always be dry.",35.00,France_Other,Red_Blend
"Blackberry and cassis flood the nose and mouth of this blend, with a touch of greenness and earthy spice adding depth. Gripping tannins take hold on the palate but fade nicely into the tobacco-leaf-tinged finish.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Cabernet_Sauvignon-Merlot

"Made from Malbec, this is a full-bodied, dry rosé, with ripe strawberry fruit. It has the acidity that carries the wine, but is more of a food rosé than an apéritif.",12.00,Southwest_France,Rosé
"This medium-bodied red displays an array of dried spices alongside ample black-cherry fruit. It's fresher and firmer than the 2007 (also reviewed this month), featuring some slightly dusty tannins on the finish. Drink now–2015 or so.",25.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"The Quiot family's Château du Trignon is located in Gigondas, but has holdings in several nearby villages. The 2007 Rasteau is rather fruit driven (cherries and plums), but manages to fold in hints of chocolate, anise and French roast. Supple on the finish. Drink now–2015.",25.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend

"The 2007 Les Launes starts off with a harmonious mix of Mexican chocolate, clove, leather and cherry aromas, and the flavors closely mirror them. The wine is mouthfilling yet fresh, and the only quibble is that the flavors fade a bit quickly on the finish. Drink now–2015.",21.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"An easily accessible, easy-drinking style of Crozes-Hermitage, Ferraton's 2007 La Matinière displays a lovely balance between clean red fruit (cherries, raspberries), baking spices, cracked pepper and a faintly herbal tinge. Drink it now and over the next few years.",22.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Surprisingly soft for a Riesling, which gives the wine an easy attractiveness. Lively, fresh acidity and green apple and melon flavors follow through to the end, perhaps softened by a sense of the wine being off-dry.",24.00,Alsace,Riesling

"Possessed of mouthfilling plum and black cherry fruit, this supple-textured Gigondas doesn't offer a ton of nuance but is well made and satisfies for its persistent and authoritative flavors. Drink it over the next 4–5 years.",35.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend

"Lively and vibrant, bright scents of apple and fresh orange supremes quickly fade on the light-weight palate and on the clean but short finish.",11.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"With almost Chardonnay richness, this is a ripe, smooth, creamy apple-like wine. The palate is concentrated and spicy, with only a light showing of acidity to give a final bite.",17.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"Dominated by aromas of dried spices, cedar and leather, this full-bodied, lusty red shows more oak than fruit, although the tannins are clearly ripe and the body of the wine adequately supports the ample cedar and vanilla flavors. You could drink it now for its bold flavors, or wait 2–3 years to see if it attains greater harmony over time.",44.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This is a wine that doesn't mess with niceties, but is right in your face. Intensely perfumed, almost a caricature of Gewürz, this is rich, moving into sweetness, concentrated and very spicy.",26.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"This powerfully built Gigondas appears to have 5–8 years of aging potential, so perhaps in time this rating will look conservative. For the moment, the wine displays balanced aromas and flavors of garrigue, leather and plum along with a firm tannic structure. The blend is 80% Grenache, 10% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre.",40.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend

"Lightly perfumed and floral, this is classic mineral and gunflint Riesling. It is light in texture, clean and refreshing, with some crisp pear fruit and green plum skin tannins.",15.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Guigal customarily releases many of the firm's red wines after additional cellaring, so this 2006 is still on the market. It's nicely balanced for current drinking despite some slightly drying tannins on the finish, which only serve to accentuate the mouthwatering black cherry fruit. Leather and spice notes add welcome nuance.",30.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"93-95. Barrel sample. A firm and tannic wine, it has the weight to support its tannins. It's balanced, solid and dense, with a powerful shot of black fruits.",170.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend

"From the family behind Bosquet des Papes in Châteauneuf, this is a solid Côtes du Rhône, with modest tannins but decent structure and typical notes of leather, dried cherries, chocolate and cinnamon. Drink it over the next few years.",16.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"For a Gewürz, this is restrained, a soft, open and attractively easy wine, lightly hinting at lychee and pear juice. Drink now.",19.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer

"Wines from Plan de Dieu are rarely seen in the U.S., but this is an attractive offering from the Quiot family's holdings in that region. It's dark in profile, with aromas and flavors that veer from black cherry toward black olive and coffee. It's medium bodied, with some fine, slightly dusty tannins on the finish. Drink it over the next few years.",19.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A blend of 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah, this is another example of the fine values coming out of the Costières de Nîmes. It's a medium-bodied wine with a velvety texture and a fine balance between herbs and raspberry fruit on the one hand and dark berries and earth on the other. Drink it over the next 2–3 years.",12.00,Rhône_Valley,Grenache-Syrah
"This feels light and rather dilute. It has varietal pepper and some spice, but the main effect is one of acidity, crispness and freshness. The lychee tropical fruit element is underplayed in favor of crispness. It should certainly work with food.",25.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris

"Fresh in style, especially for the hot, dry 2007 vintage, reflecting the slightly higher elevation of the Massif d'Uchaux, this medium-bodied wine offers oodles of cherry-berry fruit. It's nothing too serious or complex, just good, quaffable pleasure to consume over the next 2–3 years.",12.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"87-89. Barrel sample. Smooth and rich, this wine is dominated by firm tannins, tarry fruit and new wood.",100.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"With its concentrated yellow fruits, this is already a powerful wine. It is packed with acidity, toast, peach flavors and minerality, starting out as a gorgeously rich wine from a ripe vintage. Of course, it will age over many years; open in 10 years.",410.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Gentil is used in Alsace to describe a blended wine. This is soft and smooth, making a great apéritif, with just an edge of crispness to go over the rich pear and green plum flavors. Finishes with a burst of pineapple.",12.00,Alsace,White_Blend
"A soft, open style of Riesling, just hinting at a steely core. It has perfumed white fruits, a youthful texture of apple skins, followed by ripe acidity. It needs a few more months in bottle to bring it into balance.",20.00,Alsace,Riesling
"A gorgeously rich wine, powered by tannins but just as importantly by ripe berry fruit and crisp acidity. Smoky wood flavors blend with juicy fruit, powerful dark tannins and an intensely fresh finish. Age for seven years or more.",110.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"The walled Clos de la Barre is a Jadot monopoly. This 2009 has great depth of flavor, hinting at the Volnay richness while remaining structured. That makes it a concentrated wine, red and black fruits mingling with wood and intense acidity. For long-term aging over six years and more.",68.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir

"Starts off slightly tarry or rubbery, but soon unfolds to reveal hints of jammy fruit and chocolate balanced against olive notes. A bit chunky, but solid, with a dusting of fine tannins like cocoa on the finish. Drink now–2013.",15.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"On the dusty, earthy side of the Rhône spectrum, with hints of cordite accenting cherry fruit. It's undeniably fresh and vibrant, just lacks some of the richness characteristic of the 2007 vintage.",25.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Just up the slope from the grand cru of La Romanée, Les Petits Monts has produced a wine that combines structure with a more opulent character. That gives rich damson and red plum fruits along with exhilarating acidity and a firm core of tannin. The wine needs aging for 5–6 years.",115.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A wine that brings out intense minerality, a tight citric tang and a beautiful structure. With its lime and grapefruit acidity laid over ripe yellow fruits shot through with toast, this is a wine that should age many years, mellowing into an open, generous richness.",215.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This rich wine balances ripe yellow fruits with intense citrus acidity in a harmonious whole. Its structure is laden with minerality, toast and a smooth, delicious creamy aftertaste.",260.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Rich and rounded, packed with yellow fruits and pineapple flavors, this is a warm, opulent wine, combining toast and fruit. True, there is some minerality, but this Meursault revels in its ripe fruit and generosity.",155.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"At this stage, the wine is all dark structure and very firm. It will need time to develop its full potential as an intensely rich wine. Concentrated and firm, it is powered by tannins as well as sweet red fruits. So age for five years at least.",85.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Crisp and soft, backed with bone-dry acidity. Green apple, green plums, it's all about freshness and light. Refreshing, with just a shot of spice and pepper.",13.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc

"A medium-sweet, spicy wine that offers good fresh guava flavor to balance the ripe texture. The finish is fresh. Screw cap.",19.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"While the aromas of this young wine reveal considerable toast, on the palate the wine brings forward the ripe apricot and mango flavors to go with that wood. As it matures, these elements will coalesce with the taut, tense mineral texture into an superb, ageworthy terroir-driven wine.",225.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"On the lighter side of the Côtes du Rhône spectrum, with a slightly briary note to the cherry fruit. Turns more olivaceous on the silky-textured finish. Drink now.",10.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A beautifully ripe wine, with the new wood just a hint in the background. The wine has rich red plums and black cherries, laced with the most intense acidity. It is a dense, firmly concentrated wine with a long ahead.",90.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir

"While the wine does have richness, it's the mineral and citrus side that is coming through at this stage. The balance with the wood aging is so right that you feel the toast rather than tasting it. As it matures, the wine will deepen in intensity and power, certainly over the next 5–10 years.",150.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A deliciously fruity wine, its bright apricot, pineapple and peach flavors open and generous. Of course, there is a more serious core of structure, lemon zest and dryness to promise aging. At the end, though, fruit and a light toastiness give immediate pleasure.",145.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Pure strawberry and red cherry fruits with a twist of acidity make this a wine that is already delicious. Just under the surface is a firm wood-and-tannin character and a dense, if juicy, structure. Age for 4–5 years.",44.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This is a relatively lightweight Costières de Nîmes, despite being 100% Syrah. Modest cherry and black pepper notes are pretty enough, just lack intensity and fade a bit quickly on the finish.",18.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"A simple, quaffable Gigondas, with bright cherry fruit on the nose and on the palate, modest tannins and an easygoing personality. Drink it over the next few years.",27.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Amply displays the charms and shortocmings of the 2008 vintage: complex if slightly herbal cherry fruit, medium body and great freshness. Drink now–2013.",14.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A soft and open wine, with a charm and delicacy; green fruits lie over bright acidity. It is a lively, bright, uncomplicated,  easy-sipping wine.",12.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc

In 10–15 years, it will be a magnificent wine.",800.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend

A lush, satiny texture with dusty tannins and a rich mocha-infused finish.",25.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend

"The beauty of Krug's rosé is the sense of bottle age, of that extra richness. That means the wine is not just the sum of its delicious red berry fruits.

"Importer Bobby Kacher has a knack for finding great value rosés from the south of France, and this is a top example. Among Rhône Valley vignerons, the Gard, which lies on the western side of France's Rhône River, is known for its Syrah, so it's no surprise this is 100% Syrah, produced by the saignée method of “bleeding” a portion of the juice off the skins after a short maceration.

"The master of Savigny-lès-Beaune, Bize has produced a powerful, expressive wine from this small single vineyard. It has serious structure, although the sumptuous black-fruit flavors are already showing. Concentrated, rich and fruity, this will age for at least five years.",46.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"The Clos de la Croix de Pierre forms part of the En Caradeux premier cru, and it creates poised wines. This is the red partner to a white also produced by Louis Jadot, and it displays juicy red fruit, layered with firm tannins. Drinkable now, but also capable of aging for five years.",45.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This is a round, rich and soft style of Chardonnay. It feels generous, and its yellow fruit flavor pushes through the acidity. It slowly opens to reveal complex tropical-fruit notes, and it will develop further, so give it another four years.",75.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is a closed, smoke-filled wine, and its tannins and toasty wood character currently dominate, which gives it a bitter edge. It has richness, with hints of juicy fruit that sit under the structure. Give it at least six years.",93.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir

"Very fresh, crisp and apply, this 100% Chardonnay Champagne also has a soft side from the relatively high dosage. That gives the wine some richness and adds touches of yellow fruits. This bottling could do with some more aging to add complexity, although it's delicious now.",55.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"A ripe and honeyed wine, this is dry and with acidity along with fresh fruitiness. It's crisply textured, refreshingly perfumed and with delicious, pure apple flavors and acidity. It's a wine to drink now, although better to age until 2017.",17.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Another terrific value from the Costières de Nîmes, this features exquisite scents of grilled herbs—think thyme, rosemary, lavender—with ripe blueberries and roasted meat. It's open-knit and velvety on the palate already, so drink it now through 2018.",18.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend

"Grilled yellow plum and anise aromas set the stage for this blend of 47% Roussanne, 40% Grenache Blanc and 13% Clairette. It's full and plump on the palate, with smoky notes that accent the plum and melon flavors on the lengthy finish.",60.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend

"Oak aging has added layers of vanilla and cinnamon, clove and menthol to this wine's ample black cherry fruit. There's a velvety plushness unusual for Crozes-Hermitage, but it adds welcome dimension to the finish.",36.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This huge, rich wine has weight and density. What make it still recognizably Bordeaux are the black currant fruits, acidity and the stylish tannins.

Owners Mallet Frères use parcel selection for this 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon blend.",30.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend

"With its firm tannins and structure, this is a wine that's made in the traditional Nuits-St.-Georges style. But it's also packed with ripe red fruit, and it has a jammy character and an open feel. There is no doubt that this is a wine to age for at least five years.",100.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Fragrant and generous, this ripe wine shows its fruitiness as easily as it reveals its structure. Its ripe, full-bodied character remains tightly textured, which makes it an age-worthy selection.",60.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Only a small portion of this vineyard is planted with Chardonnay, and it has produced a minerally wine that's both crisp and ripe. The acidity is dominant at this stage, which lends the palate a juicy, peach- and citrus-like character. This wood-aged selection needs time.",40.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay

"This is an attractive pale-pink wine, faintly coppery in hue. It's also a bit confected, with candied strawberry and watermelon flavors reminiscent of bubble gum, but backed by white chocolate and briny notes. It's plump on the palate, then falls off rapidly on the finish.",15.00,Rhône_Valley,Rosé
"Bright with fruit, this is a crisp and fresh wine. Acidity gives a strongly citrus character while allowing the potential of riper fruit and delicious pear juice flavors. It's a wine for apéritif, light and deliciously poised. It is a blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Sémillon and Sauvignon Gris from the Xavier Milhade family, now in its fourth and fifth generations on the estate.",12.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Chapoutier's flamingo-pink rosé is a blend of Grenache, Syrah and Cinsault that's features strawberry bubble-gum aromas and flavors, some melon fruit and a slightly chalky finish. Drink up.",16.00,Rhône_Valley,Rosé
"Tight and packed with acidity, this is a very fruity wine dominated by herbaceous Sauvignon flavors that need to soften. It seems one-dimensional, just herbaceous and citrus.",13.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Situated two miles north of the castle of Blaye, this estate has produced an obviously wood-aged, heavily extracted wine. At this stage, this wine is all tannins, smoky acidity and structure. It will always be concentrated with wood, although this will soften.",16.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"While there are certainly tannins here, this wine is essentially about fruit. Stalky black currants and berries dominate this perfumed wine with its fresh acidity and crisp, clean aftertaste. Drink now.",9.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"With its little seasoning of Muscadelle in the blend, this is an attractively perfumed wine. It has bright acidity, plenty of herbaceous flavors and a final pear and crisp apple aftertaste. Drink from the end of 2015.",9.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"This stalky, firmly tannic wine is still developing. Dominated by Merlot, it has black currant fruits in the background with acidity and crispness. Give this structured wine another few years and drink from 2016.",15.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This fragrant, spicy wine is soft and rounded. It is still developing to give a wine that will be warm and full. It misses something of the essential fruitiness.",12.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend

"The Xavier Flouret brand covers the world, but its Sancerre is always among its most consistent. It is balanced, fruity and only lightly herbaceous. Touches of white currants add to the fruitiness of this ready-to-drink wine.",23.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"From the vineyards of the grand castle of Sancerre, this has rich red and black cherry fruits, a line of the purest acidity and just the right amount of tannic structure to allow it to age a little longer. It has weight and final ripeness.",31.00,Loire_Valley,Pinot_Noir
"From a 15-acre property to the east end of Bergerac, this is a ripe, rounded and smooth wine. It has attractive signs of its wood aging, giving a polished feel to the ripe tannins and red berry fruits. It is ready to drink, but will age until 2020.",24.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Parcels of vines on the Phélan-Ségur estate are used for this second label. The wine, with its firm tannins, is developing well.

"Produced from old vines in Verdigny, this is rich while still totally crisp. Ripe yellow and white fruits, apricots and apples are cut with acidity and a taut, mineral character. While this wine is ready to drink, it will improve for some time, and will be better in 2017.",50.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"This Demeter-certified biodynamic wine is made in an immediately enjoyable, drink-now style. Brandied black cherries and sun-baked earth mark the nose, while the palate is full, creamy and plush. It's warm, ripe and welcoming from start to finish.",75.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Give this wine some time in the glass after pouring (or decant in advance of serving), as it has an earthy edge to its aromas that only dissipates with airing. Once that clears, black cherry and tapenade notes take hold and persist through the warm, open-knit finish.",65.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This is a tight, textured and fruity wine. With a great mineral texture and steely structure, it is a wine for some aging. Lemon and pink grapefruit flavors sheer through the texture, still waiting to balance. From 2017 it will be a fine wine.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Complex and rich, this is an impressive, concentrated wine. It has great acidity that balances flavors of ripe white fruits and apple skins, and lends a tight, taut texture. The wine should be aged for at least six months before drinking.",14.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"This rounded, full wine is densely packed with fruit, but also tannins that add balance. Blackberry flavors come through the dry structure to give both richness and freshness. The aftertaste is ripe, juicy and delicious. Drink now, but best from 2015.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Smooth and fruity, it's full of citrus and ripe pear fruit. Structured and quite tangy, it has potential to improve through late 2014.",35.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay

"Made from fruit that was sourced from a 2.4-acre plot on the steep slopes of Vergisson, this is an intense, ripe, wood-aged wine. The acidity is allied to the spice and yellow fruit flavors. A concentrated wine of great purity, this is worth aging for several years.",55.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Aged for 30 months in wood, this Chablis has a distinctively ripe and rich character that puts it closer to Meursault in style. Only on the finish, through all of the toast and fruit flavors, does the steely acidity emerge.",53.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Les Fourneaux is one of the smallest premier crus. Rich and balanced, this wine is full of pear and apricot flavors. It combines a minerally edge with a generous structure and fruitiness. Delicious now, but keep it for 3–4 years.",65.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Full bodied, rich and ripe, this wine has a minerally texture and is loaded with tropical fruit, citrus and apricot flavors. It's a serious selection that needs some aging. This is one of a series of single-vineyard wines from the Comte de Ternay estate.",36.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This has firm tannins, and it demonstrates the potential of its juicy fruit flavors. With its powerful structure, this is a slowly developing selection that needs at least five years in a cellar.",57.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"While this wine has the crispness of Chablis, it also has weight and concentration. The bright green-apple flavor is underpinned by a sense of minerality. Nervy, tense yet fruity, this can age for 2–3 years.",45.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A forward and expressive wine, this blend of 60% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre leads with attractively jammy black-fruit flavors and hints of vanilla and licorice root.

"This blend of two-thirds Syrah and one-third Mourvèdre is fresh and aromatic, showing some peppery-gingery spice to go with watermelon and strawberry notes. It's medium in body, with an abbreviated finish.",13.00,France_Other,Rosé
"This is a heavily wood-aged wine with a bitter character redeemed by the ripe blackberry fruits from a blend of 65% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc.

"This is a curiously juicy wine that is not fully integrated with the dry tannins. It has a hard-edged texture, a dry character that sits uneasily with the crisp black currant fruitiness.",45.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"With a sense of tannic structure and a dry background, this is a firm wine. It has some weight, although the texture and the black currant fruits are light and stylish rather than dense. Drink from 2016.",13.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Bright, lightly-smoked red currant and berry fruits dominate this juicy, fresh wine. A plum-skin texture leads on to some firm tannins. The aftertaste is fruity and light.",10.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend

"Although obviously still young, this fruity wine will develop fast. It benefits from the ripe fruit of the vintage, sweet black currants and berries that are given a crisp edge by the acidity. Already balanced, it will be drinkable from 2016.",7.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A ripe wine that is almost off dry, this has a ripe cherry character, rich in the mouth and with a full texture. The aftertaste brings out spice and tannins. Bordeaux Clairet lies between rosé and red in color and in taste.",17.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend

"The wine is bone-dry with acidity as well as fragrant fruitiness. Because it comes from the south of Champagne, it has enough ripe fruit to sustain and balance this really dry character. It's ready to drink, although holding until late 2015 will help it even more.",46.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Marmandais is on the way to Cahors from Bordeaux, and the Malbec grape seems to have stopped off to produce this firmly tannic wine with its dark fruits and dense structure. A juicy, spicy character leaves a firm, solid aftertaste.",13.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"Big tannins and impressive fruits are the hallmarks of this impressive wine. It is also subtle, not showing all its flavors at once, hiding beneath tannins and structure. For this fruity vintage, it shows a strong sense of direct, solid structure, only allowing the strong black plum and berry flavors to come through slowly. It is for the long haul, so don't drink before 2022, even better later.",660.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"So smooth, this is a rich, grandiose wine. Although it is full of black currant fruits and spice flavors, the texture is most impressive. Dusty tannins are integrated with juicy fruits seamlessly.

"The wine shows the power typical of a Lafite but within the context of the fruity 2011 vintage. The immensely dense tannic structure gives the wine a solid feel that is lifted by so much ripe black currant and berry fruits. At the back, the wine has a more brooding, dark character that suggests great aging potential. Drink this wine from 2019.",685.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Huge structure, huge potential, a wine that will bring out all the fruit and density of the vintage while remaining very fresh.

"This wine has so many of the structural elements of a Saint-Estèphe, but also is enveloped by ripe fruitiness.

Drink from 2022.",65.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend

It's full in the mouth, black plum skins and intense acidity giving a lilt of freshness at the end. Drink from 2019.",250.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"There is a lightness about this vintage of Mouton Rothschild. It doesn't take away from its quality but does give the wine poise and an attractive lift. The wine is based on solid tannins, then the ripe fruit builds layers of fruitiness and freshness. It is not likely to be one of the longest-aging Moutons, but it will be delicious. Drink from 2020.",600.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A solidly structured wine, it is both elegant and intensely powerful. It is disclosing its fruitiness slowly, at the moment dense and concentrated. A restrained edge provides complexity and balance. It will need aging, so don't drink before 2022.",550.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend

"This full, ripe wine offers rich apple and pear flavors as well as considerable acidity. The wine is concentrated in citrus and green fruits which complement each other and add to the rich character. Drink from the end of 2017.",30.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Yves Gras is one of the appellation's standard bearers, and this mid-level bottling doesn't disappoint. He's toned down the use of oak in recent years, allowing more black cherry fruit to shine, matched by hints of grilled meat, mocha and black olive. It's full-bodied, mouthfilling and harmonious, with a long, supple finish.",50.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Swathes of botrytis reveal themselves seductively on this sweet wine. It is rich in flavors, but still vibrant with acidity. Fine balance and intense flavors of apricots, honey and spice give it potential to age well. Drink from 2015.",28.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Splash this around while pouring to help dissipate some reductive notes and reveal pleasant raspberry and herbal aromas. It's medium in body, with a welcoming suppleness to the texture and a silky feel on the finish, which folds in hints of mocha.",12.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend

"Toasty aromas go through to the palate, highlighting the wood aging. It is tense, mineral, packed with apple and lemon acidity. The aftertaste is equally crisp and bright.",23.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay

"Full of tropical fruit aromas, this is a rounded and rich wine. Full in the mouth, it delivers ripe peach, apricot and mango fruits. The texture is smooth, generous and ready to drink.",18.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay

"Fruity and rounded, this has attractive, citrus-like acidity that cuts through the caramel and apricot flavors. There is a delicious, forward orange-juice flavor that adds to the fresh feel of the wine. It's ready to drink, although it will also age.",55.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Initially smooth and rounded, this wine opens to reveal a structured character. A note of tangy lemon zest cuts through the pear and quince flavors, which creates a balance between richness and tautness. Ready to drink in 1–2 years.",60.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"An elegant yet ripe wine, this comes laced with citrus acidity, and the yellow fruit and melon flavors give it a sense of richness. It's lively and crisp, and it has a toasty base. Age it for 3–4 years.",90.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay

"Very floral, fragrant wine, its acidity a foil for the ripe tropical and white fruits. There is a definite mineral texture here, with just a hint of sweetness that will make this wine great with Asian food. Screwcap.",15.00,Southwest_France,Chardonnay-Sauvignon
"Earthy, herbal accents of forest floor and garrigue complement the black-fruit core of this solid, ripe wine. The palate is juicy and rich, and although it's a bit straightforward, it's balanced, attractive and enjoyable nonetheless.",25.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Here's a bright and aromatic selection, with forward aromas of red plum, cherry and raspberry. Mouthwatering and inviting, ripe and juicy fruit flavors flood the palate. This is fresh, lively and extremely approachable now.",13.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend

"This celebration of Tannat is a balanced while severe and structured wine. Plenty of juicy fruit is ready to come out from behind the dry, tannic structure. There is power here as well in this wine that is firm and needs to age. Drink from 2019.",15.00,Southwest_France,Tannat
"Named after the wife of the previous owner, this top cuvée from Château de Cénac is powered by its structure and dark tannins.

Then the long, mouthwatering finish folds in hints of honey and pineapple without any hint of bitterness.",85.00,Rhône_Valley,Viognier

"This powerful and rich 100% Malbec from the western edge of Cahors is still so young. Big and fruity with ripe tannins that are surrounded by concentrated fruit, it is only just rounding out with a smoothness that comes from the wood aging. This small-production wine is named after a statue of Notre Dame in the vineyards of this family estate taken over by daughter Martine and husband Serge Costes 20 years ago. Drink from 2018.",55.00,Southwest_France,Malbec

"It must be unique to find any Bordeaux in a Burgundy style bottle. Certainly this ultra-rich wine owes much to Burgundian Chardonnay. But under the sweet fruit, there is no mistaking the Muscadelle perfume and spice that give a bite, a dry, peppery finish and a very different character",65.00,Bordeaux,Muscadelle
"Rich and complex, this is a densely flavored rosé. It has spice and tangerine orange zest as well as a more complex red pepper and red currant character. It is a wine for fish or ratatouille.",20.00,Provence,Rosé

"Almost black in color, this prestige 100% Malbec cuvée is as intense as it is powerful. Dark and brooding, still very young, it shows its wood aging strongly. As it ages, this richness will mellow well to give a concentrated while stylish wine. This small-production wine is named after a statue of Notre Dame in the vineyards of this family estate taken over by daughter Martine and husband Serge Costes 20 years ago. Drink from 2019.",55.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"A ripe wine, very open and smooth. The tannins are dark, but it is the fruit—blackberry and red plums—that comes right through. Look beneath this charm, and there is also a wine with more structure, perfumed and ageworthy.",50.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend

Along with the dry character, there is the beginnings of red berry fruit. The wine needs several years.",19.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A rich wine from a fine Sauternes year. It has honey, sweet orange marmalade and just enough freshness. At the same time, there is enough botrytis to give a good dry edge. With its weight and bit of spice, it could age.",37.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Classic spice and lychee aromas lead to a wine that is medium sweet, attractive but one-dimensional. It has perfumed, candy shop flavors, almost exaggerated. Screwcap.",15.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer

"Soft-fruited Champagne, with pear and pink grapefruit flavors. It has a bitter almond edge that cuts through the acidity. The finish is soft, towards the sweet end of brut.",35.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
A wine that certainly benefits from the warm 2009 vintage. The burnt wood flavors are too prominent for the cherry fruits. Perhaps in a year it will be better integrated.,75.00,Alsace,Pinot_Noir
"Crustacés means shellfish. Does the wine go with shellfish? Yes, with its fine, light, just steely acidity, a perfumed character and its bright, clean finish.",12.00,Alsace,White_Blend

The subtly textured palate lends structure and depth, with ample acidity providing lift and balance. Pair this with simple grilled meat or chicken.",21.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé
"Subdued, riper fruit has not yet come to the surface. Notions of Bramley apple are evoked on the nose; on the palate they show as the more rounded flavor of baked Bramley. Hovering above it all is grated lemon zest, pulling fruit, texture and freshness tautly together in a dry, fresh yet mellow finish. The more you taste, the more the still-underlying fruit yearns to rise to the surface. Best to give this some time so it can show its true, exciting colours.",24.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Rounded wine, showing ripe tropical flavors as well as a more citrus character. The wine is full, attractively textured with a buttery edge. Spice and green herbs come through to finish. Screwcap.",12.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Austere and firm, this is still many years from being ready to drink. For now, its potential is apparent in the juicy black fruits, dark tannins and solid structure. It has much of the structure of the vintage, well clothed in fuller fruits.",15.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A fruity, strawberry flavored wine with some depth and structure. It has richness as well as a fresh citrus character. It could benefit from some aging although it's certainly ready to drink this summer.",15.00,Provence,Rosé

"While the wine does have considerable tannins, it also has the ripe Merlot fruit to support it. Good acidity, black currant fruits, smoky wood, all the elements are there. It will always be firm, but should mature well.",45.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Big, dense wine, with dusty tannins and ripe red plum fruits. The wine is concentrated, fruity while also structured. It is already balanced, the acidity giving freshness, the texture showing the delicious ripe character of the vintage.",45.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"At this stage, a wine that is dominated by wood. The weight and the ripe fruit are there as well to suggest potential dark fruits, black plums, damsons and a juicy character. The rich fruit should begin to show well in a year, but the wine needs aging 3–4 years.",30.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"With flavors of wood aging as well as sweet tannins, this is a concentrated and richly fruity wine. It has the ripe fruit of 2009, sweet berries, the tannins cushioned within the softness.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend

"From a vineyard that lies just beneath the Grand Cru vineyards of Gevrey-Chambertin, this is a well-structured wine. It has a smoky character from the wood aging, giving complexity to the red fruits and dense texture. The acidity of the vintage shows strongly, giving a fruity aftertaste. Drink from 2020.",160.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Peachy overtones hover around the rose-petal scent of this fruity offering. This aromatic combo re-appears on the palate where it is rounded off with a little residual sweetness that suits the plush palate rather well. Here and there are wondrous glimpses of clear honey, dried peach and honeysuckle. Citrus freshness provides a lovely counterpoint and carries the long finish.",40.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"Feathery, lifted notes of citrus, lemon zest and leaf announce a lightness of touch. Some topnotes of chamomile tisane swing alongside. The palate is fresh, taut, dry and light-footed. Deeper notions of fruit are still just hinted at, a core of fruit that still takes time before it is unlocked. Purity and elegance mark this one out.",36.00,Alsace,Riesling
"A flinty nose of citrus purity hints that this still requires bottle age, but all the elements of a great wine are present. It offers a bundled concentration of flavor and fruit, and a straight backbone of acidity pervades everything with a sense of purity. Right now, fresh citrus notes of lemon pith, peel and flesh dominate aromatically, but this will blossom. There are already inklings of honey and orange in the background but only time will reveal what cabinet of wonders is hidden here. Drink 2017–2025.",55.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Honeyed notes of pear promise oriental richness. The palate cuts this opulence, edged with Seville orange spice and a streak of zesty lime. This interplay between baroque and discipline continues, creating a scintillating experience. Enjoy the ride and marvel at all the spicy overtones.",60.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"Very ripe, red-cheeked Mirabelles and orange peel represent the aromatic top notes. With more air, mandarin juice becomes apparent, and the palate is wonderfully taut and concentrated. There is a haunting purity and a strong undertow of earth and stone that soars on the long finish.",55.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"This concentrated wine has dark tannins as well as perfumed red fruits, blackberry flavors and a dense structure. The old vines give extra intensity and the need to age. Drink from 2016.",20.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc

"A very structured wine, its firm tannins sitting over the potential of rich blackberry fruits. It does need a year or two for the elements to come together. Spice from wood gives added interest, while the wine finishes with serious acidity.",21.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Ripe black fruits combine with bitter chocolate and toast from the wood to give a very ripe wine. It is structured at this stage but is likely to ripen and round out over the next 3–4 years to give a rich, smooth, Merlot style.",34.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Weighty with richness and good concentration. There are flavors of mint, black fruits, the tannins firmly embedded in the ripe texture. It seems so approachable now, but will also age—the acidity and drier finish show that.",35.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Attractive white Bordeaux blend, much better than the red from the same estate. It has a delicious ripe fruit character with pineapple, lime and kiwi flavors and final acidity.",11.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend

"Chocolate and ripe black fruits go with a lively, spicy acidity that gives the wine a great lift. It is lively and concentrated.",45.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Deiss has brought quite a bit of flavor intensity to the often recalcitrant Pinot Blanc; Indian spices, browned apple, clove and petroleum are the themes here. Concentration is evident on the crisp palate, which finishes on a vanilla note.",35.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"A unique wine for Alsace, this blend of Chardonnay and its kissing cousin, Pinot Auxerrois, is fashioned in a Burgundy style. It's stylish and richly textured with vanilla and luscious tropical fruit up front and notes of apple and wet stones at the back. Flavorful but short finish. Try with salmon. Drink now or hold a year or two for more complexity.",36.00,Alsace,White_Blend
"This is white Bordeaux at its freshest, bursting with herbaceous flavors, very grassy. It does have some weight of green plum flesh and a creamy texture. Delicious.",12.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend

"A wine that disdains the typical fruit profile, aromas here turn to vanilla, browned apple and savory Asian dishes. The palate has good weight and firm acidity but is a bit lacking in appealing flavor. Medium finish. Drink up.",32.00,Alsace,Riesling

"A lifting menthol streak infuses the ripe red plum and berry aromas and flavors of this wine, with a nice minerality lingering underneath it all.

Very drinkable now.",19.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend

"The slightly more evolved nose that effortlessly fuses crushed chamomile leaf and lemon zest also hints at dark fir honey. It glides seamlessly into a fast-flowing, straight channel of acidity. There is movement and poise in this virtual journey into freshness and aroma. It is the lemon that lasts longest on the palate, which is dry and of exquisite purity.",28.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Taut citrus, cleansing lemon and brisk grapefruit show an uncompromsing, dry Riesling that majors in tense citrus and wet-stone flavors. There is a linearity and a very alluring purity that deserves to develop further. This is lovely and briskly refreshing now, but time in bottle will bring out more earthy, stony complexity. Drink 2017–2025.",32.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Earth and roses, lemon zest and orange flesh: these are the contrasts of this refreshing, toned but textured Gewurztraminer that shows the full weight of its rose perfume on the palate.

This lazy, decadent wine is a good choice for mild blue cheese. Drink now or over the next few years.",28.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris

"Mouthfilling and fat—almost too much so—this is a chunky, weighty example of Tavel that almost demands to be served alongside red meat, like a light red rather than a rosé. Raspberry and white chocolate notes offer just a hint of peppery spice on the finish.",34.00,Rhône_Valley,Rosé

"There is a distinct phenolic edge on this earthy, lemon-dominated and taut Riesling. Fruit—apart from citrus—is subsumed into an earthy, tense and concentrated palate. This needs more time to relax into itself and should blossom with more bottle age. Drink 2017–2020.",35.00,Alsace,Riesling

"Quite youthful, this is a sprightly and charming wine, evincing aromas of white flowers and peaches. The crisp palate has lemon-lime notes and a chalky edge. Medium, citrusy finish. Drink now or hold a few years for more complexity.",33.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Aging this wine in 100% new wood has left it very dry, the fruit tight and black but oddly drained of richness. There is sweetness along with prune flavors. But the tannins may never soften enough.",22.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Aromas of new wood follow through with rich toast, balanced with black currant fruits. The wine is fresh, the acidity a strong presence along with a layer of dried fruit flavors and tannins.",13.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend

"La Nerthe's late-ripening Mourvèdre typically shines the brightest in warm vintages, which 2008 was not. The result is a leathery, peppery wine with rather crisp, cherry-inflected fruit. Drink it over the next several years.",50.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Don't be confused by the Côtes du Rhône appellation—this is 100% Syrah from the northern Rhône. So while it shows black cherry and cassis fruit and hints of cracked pepper, it remains medium-bodied, with a dustiness to the finish.",15.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah

"Because of such small harvests in 2013 because of hail, Alex Gambal decided to make one wine from all his premier cru parcels in Savigny-lès-Beaune. This wine is rich and ripe, full of sweet crushed strawberry flavors as well as a dry core of structure. Age this fine wine and drink from 2017.",45.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Yellow plum, sweet apple and juicy pear form an appetizing, aromatic trinity. Those apple flavors, some of them fresh, some bruised, some baked, become the central theme of the lemon-focused palate. With some time, honeyed notes come to the fore and suggest that many things still lie hidden in this fruit-laden Riesling. The finish is dry, the entire wine is focused and still taut. It's delicious now but will reward cellaring.Drink 2015–2025.",30.00,Alsace,Riesling

"Ott specializes in rosés with weight and alcohol.

Full and definitely for food, the wine should be aged another few months, so drink from mid-2016.",49.00,Provence,Rosé
"This is a concentrated, dark and brooding wine. Its complexity comes from the interplay of tannins and rich red fruits, laced with tight acidity. Serious and dense, it is a wine for long aging. Drink this impressive wine from 2019.",153.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir

"This wine needs some time to open up after pouring to fully express itself. With time, rich notes of black currant, brambly berry and black cherry grace the nose and mouth, with a touch of licorice root and espesso unfolding after swallow.",12.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Wild barnyard notes dance among the rich dark fruit and berry core. Garrigue and bramble accents add more character to the smooth and silky mouth, while the medium finish lands on a softly oak-kissed flavor. Drink now.",14.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend

"High acidity makes this wine taste bright, fruity and light. There is only a hint of dry tannin to the red currant flavor.",23.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"There are very firm, dry tannins here, and they will likely always be with the wine. That said, it has a certain weight of fruit, fresh currant skins and a final cranberry acidity. It really needs food.",30.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend

"The 60-40 Grenache-Syrah blend is becoming common among Costières de Nîmes rosés, and this one does it well, combining delicate berry notes with cool mineral shadings. It's a little rounder and less crisp than many of its genre, but it's still very good.",12.00,Rhône_Valley,Rosé

"A full, rich wine, with tobacco aromas and fine juiciness that is showing a more licorice, chocolate character while retaining red berry flavors. Acidity cuts through the wine along with toast notes.",30.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Always a dense, dark and concentrated selection, La Forge is a wine that is immediately attractive but would be best after a few years of cellaring. Notes of dark berry preserves, muddled boysenberry, raspberry sauce, cocoa, leather and truffle abound on the nose and palate.

This is rounded and rich with an immensely concentrated phenolic vein that lends structure and poise. The finish is lasting but demure.",24.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer

Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",57.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay

The fruits are restrained, but there is exuberance from the acidity, the fine tannins and the jammy finish. A wine that is evolving already, but will also age well.",75.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Solid, firm wine that brings its tannins to bear on the rich plum juice and black berry fruits. The tannins act as an important element here, giving concentration, tightening the fresh fruit, and underpinning the final bright acidity. Age for 4–5 years.",42.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"As rich and opulent as its red wine pair, this is ripe and soft, a swirl of velvet tempered by citrus and sweet and fresh acidity. The toast of the wood is only just evident, its presence felt as much as tasted. Despite its richness, it does remain wedded to Burgundy, as evidenced by the tight, steely finish. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",102.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Austere and mineral initially, this is a complex wine, showing Asian spices as well as dark plum and berry fruits. It is layered with powerful tannins, which give the wine almost as much structure as fruit. A powerhouse that will age well.",280.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"As the label says, the wine is off dry, but with its great, refreshing acidity, it is also crisp and fruity. Baked apples and citrus flavors mingle with a lightly mineral texture to give a lively, fragrant wine. Drink now.",17.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"The ludicrously heavy bottle must have cost more than the pleasant, fruity wine inside. The wood aging has had the effect of rounding the red berry fruits, while the juicy acidity points up freshness.",10.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Pierced with acidity, this has intense black currant fruits and some smoky bacon flavors from the wood aging. It is firm, dry, concentrated, although not yet fully expressive.",17.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"At first taste, the tannins dominate. Then fresher fruit shows through. The wine is firmly dry, the texture linear, the fruit showing some black currant character.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Full and rich, this has intense, ripe black-plum fruit, with layers of wood aging that give the wine a dry, firm character. The Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend give it tannic structure and concentrated juiciness. Age this for at least six years.",60.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Using fruit sourced from old vines, this firm, tannic and concentrated wine has a fine balance between the dense texture and bright black-plum and berry flavors. Given its tannic structure, it needs to age, although it would be a great accompaniment to a stew if consumed now.",25.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"Full of new wood and tannic flavors, this is dense, dry, very firm. It does suffer from some licorice overextraction that gives the wine a bitter edge. At the same time, the wine has a full and firm character that promises a softening over the next several years.",25.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"The famed Côte de Py Vineyard in Morgon has made a powerful and structured wine, with a black cherry flavor that's shaped by the dry, firm tannins. It is concentrated, dense and generous, with strong minerality and gritty texture. Age for 3–4 years.",16.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"Using fruit that was sourced from a five-acre parcel of old vines, the black plum fruit coddles the tannins. It shows the structure and ripeness of the vintage.",30.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
This is a lush wine that oozes with the superripe flavor of sweet blackberry. The firm tannins and dense structure act as a counterbalance and push the wine into a more structured sphere. The fruit quality and overall balance promise 4–5 years of aging.,25.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Ripe and fruity, this is full of red cherry fruit. It has a mineral-driven structure that gives it a firmly textured edge and brings out the acidity. This could age for several years.",20.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"Low intensity fruit and floral aromas are hidden in the bouquet, with minor suggestions of strawberry hull and crushed carnation to be found only upon deep nosing. Light and easy in the mouth with a short but clean finish.",11.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé
"There's a strong funkiness to this wine, which can be called barnyard or even bordering on Band-Aid, that almost overwhelms the nose and mouth. Black plum and berry flavors struggle for dominance, while spicy oak controls the close.",15.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Produced by the largest Bordeaux cooperative, this is a freshly fruity wine, with simple red fruit flavors and soft tannins. There is a smoky edge and pink raspberry acidity.",10.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Made solely from old-vine Grenache, this stands out as a horse of a different color in a flight of traditional Châteauneuf-du-Papes. It does boast a lovely suppleness and silky texture, but the aromas and flavors are strange—a sort of medicinal cherry meets boiled vegetables.",73.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A lively, fresh wine, packed with raspberry acidity and red currant flavor. The wine is bright, crisp and deliciously lively.",16.00,Provence,Rosé
"In the creamy Chablis style that is a Drouhin signature, this wine is ripe, the fresh acidity of the appellation showing behind pears flavors. There is an undercurrent of toast, but the fruit, finishing with green acidity and apple skin tannins, is dominant. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",100.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is from vines owned by Véronique Drouhin. With a tight bite of plum, tannin and smoky wood,the wine has a young structure, the color still tinged with purple, finely balanced with fresh acidity. For aging.",200.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"One of the Vincent family's single-vineyard wines from its Château de Fuissé estate. It comes from chalky soil, and this shows in the initial tight minerality that then follows through with balanced pear and peach flavors, finally rounding into elegance. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd. Editors' Choice.",57.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"If you want a more earthy style of red Burgundy, this is the wine for you. It has a definite funky edge, lying against the ripe tannins and sweet soft, jammy fruit. The acidity comes through to finish a wine with weight and character.",50.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Deliciously ripe fruit, giving softness and power at the same time. The wine has rich strawberry and black plum fruits along with red currant freshness. At the same time, it has a complex structure of firm tannins, spice and wood. The end is more generous, opulent.",83.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A firm, solid, foursquare style of wine, showing firm tannins and big, bold fruit. There is a dense dryness here surrounded by rich fruit that still shows some austerity. Cranberry and red berry flavors dominate this balanced wine. Worth aging.",115.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"By using the brand Joseph Faiveley for its négociant wines, made from purchased grapes, Faiveley is able to distinguish this range from its domaine wines. This Gevrey is luxuriously perfumed, finely structured with dusty tannins and already delicious Pinot Noir. It has a fine strain of acidity, which adds freshness to the solid character.",71.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Firmly dry, layered with new wood flavors, this is a wine that is structured, dark, flavored with red plum and black berry fruits. It has some depth and intensity, but the jammy finish doesn't suggest long aging. Enjoy over the next 3–4 years.",92.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This vineyard is the original of the Domaine de la Vougeraie, planted in 1966. It offers a village wine at the quality of premier cru, with its dense tannins, big structure and firm ripe fruits. Black plums work with black cherry acidity, cinnamon, and a mouthfilling power. Age for 3–4 years.",64.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This Grenache-based rosé, with 4% Syrah, opens with a mélange of fruity aromas that carry through to the palate. Notes of peach, guava, cherry, banana and melon are accented by a hint of garrigue. It's medium weight, with ample acidity to lift the ripe fruit flavors.",12.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Grenache-Syrah
"Here's a friendly, accessible and value-priced rosé that's perfect for warm-weather entertaining. Ripe cherry, plum and raspberry flood the nose and mouth, with a soft dusting of cocoa that adds interest and decadence. The ripe flavors are full and jammy, but balanced by medium acidity that keeps the palate fresh and the finish clean.",11.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé
"There are attractive floral and garrigue tones to the subtle fruit core of this wine, with hints of white cherry, melon rind and strawberry hull. The lively palate offers brisk acidity and lively tart-fruit flavors. A touch of white chocolate echos on the medium-length finish.",12.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé
"A burnt-toast, spicy aroma is followed by fresh black currant flavors. This is a light wine, but it is balanced, with the wood fitting well into the fruit. Drink now.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Simple but with a straightforward grapey charm, this slightly spritzy blend has medium acidity and a short, flowery finish. Good for poolside sipping.",10.00,Alsace,Alsace_white_blend
"A wine that still shows some youthful tannins, but is maturing well, its freshness subsumed into the red plum and jelly flavors. It is ready to drink now, but should be decanted.",24.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A ripe, juicy well-made, branded Bordeaux, its tannins tight but just right for the meaty chocolate flavors, spiced with wood. The acidity gives sweetness as much as freshness.",10.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Soft pear and apricot flavors over acidity make this initially attractive. Then an awkward toffee apple element creeps in, and leaves a wine that is mushy and soft.",14.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Named after a Roman centurion rather than a god of love, Saint-Amour produces structured Beaujolais. With its solid tannins and firm structure, this wine proves the point. It is concentrated, with acids and minerally red fruits dominating at the moment. It needs to age for 1–2 years.",24.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"Using grapes sourced from stony soil, this is a serious, tight and mineral-driven wine. It has firm tannins that dominate the potentially juicy red fruits. Powerful and concentrated.",19.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"Big and concentrated, this wine's spice and dark fruit flavors are sustained by solid tannins and acids. It has a rich texture that's laced with acidity, so give this concentrated wine another 4–5 years.",22.00,Southwest_France,Malbec-Merlot
"Dominated by ripe Merlot, this rich wine has a juicy blackberry flavor and reveals the judicious use of wood. It's a wine that should be aged. The chateau is owned by the Delon family of Château Léoville las Cases.",30.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A great mix of solid tannins and juicy fruit, this is a rich and structured wine, with the firm character of the year and deep blackberry flavor. It has weight and an edge of spice, finishing with acidity.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This sweet wine balances acidity with honeyed fruit. There is a touch of botrytis to go with the orange marmalade and lemon peel flavors, while the citrus-like acids cut across the palate. This is fine to drink now, yet it will also age for many years.",19.00,Southwest_France,Petit_Manseng
"This blend of Petit Manseng and Gros Manseng shows fresh apricot fruit, with delicate acidity and nervy texture. It's not for aging, so drink it now.",30.00,Southwest_France,Gros_and_Petit_Manseng
"Solid and structured, this shows the firm side of Fleurie. It is dominated by tannins that overlay the red berry fruit and the firm plum-skin texture. With its weight and concentration, this needs to age for another 2–3 years.",23.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"A soft wine, with some herbal, pear and kiwi flavors. It has just an edge of sweetness that gives it a soft aftertaste. For drinking now.",13.00,Bordeaux,Sauvignon_Blanc

Simply fruity Bordeaux. It has signs of wood and black currant fruit along with acidity and a light layer of tannin. Drink now.,25.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A bit tough and unyielding right now, Nalys's 2008 Châteauneuf-du-Pape displays adequate black cherry fruit and hints of horse stable and garrigue. It does dry out on the finish; drink it up over the next few years.",39.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A disappointing effort from a normally reliable producer, Château de Ségriès's Tavel is still pleasant enough, but it comes across as slightly heavy and confected while delivering bold cherry-berry fruit.",16.00,Rhône_Valley,Rosé
"The wine tastes sulphured, with suppressed fruit. There is some weight, with caramel and red berry fruit flavors, but it is all muted.",10.00,Provence,Rosé
"Very soft, round wine. It feels unstructured, indistinct with an overripe strawberry flavor.",10.00,Provence,Rosé
"A delicious wine, the total freshness along with the apple skin texture giving a great crisp bite. It has lively acidity that penetrates right through red cherry fruit flavors.",16.00,Provence,Rosé
"A woody, toasty wine, dominated by a high spice character. This keeps the fruit, for the moment at least, under wraps. There is weight there, just glimpses of black plums and bitter chocolate.",15.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"Ripe and soft, perfumed and floral, this is pure fruit, a pear- and peach-flavored wine with a hint of toast and almonds. It is clean as a mountain stream, so fresh, but with some weight. And just look at the alcohol—11.5% That'll save your falling off your bar stool. Screwcap.",14.00,Southwest_France,Chardonnay
"Very rich, but the wine also has a good steely edge to it, a texture of fruit skins to go with the ripest apricot flavors. It rolls satisfyingly around the mouth, a concentrated burst of fruit that, as with the steeliness, ends with crisp acidity. Imported by Boisset America.",69.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Intensely ripe fruit gives this wine a rounded, mouthfilling character, packed with sweetness, dense black jam and rich tannins. Through it all comes a fresh acidity to sharpen the palate. The finish brings back some tannins and structure.",87.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Initial high toast aromas soften to bring out spice and yellow fruits. The palate shows more fruit, but still gives layered wood over the citrus, apricot and final acidity. There is a golden feel of superripe fruit. Drink over the next 3–4 years. Imported by Boisset America.",122.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Rich, full, but properly mineral Chardonnay, the wine poised between creamy wood flavors and tight lemon and pink grapefruit acidity. Crispness vies with full-bodied fruit, leaving a deliciously satisfying balance. Drink now, but also worth aging. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",87.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Monnot seems to be good at showing off appellation characters. This wine has plenty of typical Meursualt plumpness, the fruit sitting comfortably on ripe flavors of apricots and white peaches. But there is also a core of fruit-skin structure that promises some aging potential. Imported by Robert Kacher Imports.",66.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Corton-Charlemagne should have weight, and this wine has weight. It sits plumply in the glass, a big spice- and yellow fruit-flavored wine, layered with toast and ripeness. It is developing fast, but the lingering acidity does promise 4–5 years further progress. Imported by Palm Bay International.",164.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Crisp, off-dry and straightforward, this is an unexceptional Alsace white. There are some nice tones of petroleum, but they are undercut by a distracting scent of cooking grease. Unlikely to improve with age.",14.00,Alsace,Riesling
"This is brilliantly fruity, very crisp and fragrant, with delicious spice, perfumed red fruits and lively acidity. It's very dry, with a fresh aftertaste.",17.00,Loire_Valley,Rosé
"With richness and alcohol similar to some California Chardonnays, this is a far cry from the more elegant whites of the region. A blockbuster selection, this is packed with yellow fruit and herb flavors, showing fine concentration and depth of flavor. Ready to drink, but it will age for 3–4 years.",85.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Smooth and rich, this has fine black and red cherry flavors, along with structured, dry tannins. There is a spice note from the wood aging, which is balanced by the acidity. The finish has a fine, generous texture. Give this wine at least four years.",22.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"At this stage, the wine feels lean, austere and minerally, despite the richness of the vintage. But this black-currant-driven wine is likely to age impressively. And with its dense tannins, it shouldn't be touched for at least four years.",30.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"Contrary to its flowery name, Fleurie can produce firm and tannic wines, and this selection is a case in point. It is a solid and chunky effort that is laden with tannin and bitter cherry flavor. The tight acidity needs time to settle down, so give it a couple of years.",26.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"This is structured and textured, with white fruit flavors complemented by almond and mineral notes, along with some toast from having aged in wood. Concentrated and edgy, this needs to age for another two years.",23.00,Southwest_France,White_Blend
"Smooth and unctuous in texture, this has dense black fruits that edge toward dryness from the tannins. Dark chocolate and licorice notes lend a bitter edge. Rich and modern in style, this should age over the next 5–6 years.",22.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Dense and concentrated, with a mint flavor from the new wood, this is a wine that combines rich plum and blackberry flavors with firm tannins and juicy acids. Because it is so rich, it is likely to be ready to be drink in the next 2–3 years.",24.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"Nuits-St-Georges is Faiveley's home base, so they know a thing or two when it comes to making a village wine. This is a wine that manages to combine the mineral toughness of Nuits bottlings with an extra layer of rich plum skin and juice flavor. There is a light strawberry jam character that offers some final sweetness.",63.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"In the soft, ripe style that is so characteristic of Beaune, this is a wine with sweet berries; this soft, jammy exterior is supported by structured tannins that make their presence felt under the fruit. Although it is delicious already, it could benefit from 3–4 years' aging.",60.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A powerful layer of tannin is the initial dominant element here. The fruit, black plum skins and red cherries, is behind this curtain of dryness. It shows minerality and some austerity, but looks set to develop well over the next 4–5 years.",108.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Minty tasting wine, missing out on fruitiness. It has a light texture, feeling hollow.",14.00,Provence,Rosé
"When a Bordeaux wine gets into a heavy bottle, it has something to prove. As here, when the wine has way too much wood and lacks fruit. It could balance out, but that is a long shot.",150.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Surprisingly lightweight for the vintage, this is a red fruit-flavored wine, with tannins, acidity and a fresh aftertaste. Not for aging.",25.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Taut, stalky wine, very structured. There is fruit but it is herbal, green, missing ripeness. The tannins have the same character.",14.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Full in the mouth, spiced with new wood over ginger. The fruit is rich, showing apple and pear juice flavors touched by almonds. It is ripe, delicious, finishing very fresh.",12.00,Southwest_France,Chenin_Blanc-Chardonnay

"A period of wood aging has rounded out the fruit in this rich wine. It has a dusty, soft structure, offering sweet juiciness to go with the toast and spice element. The final flavors are of berry acidity.",19.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"Opens with slightly funky cheese rind notes, though there's a nice mineral undertone and some apple character. Crisp and dry with mouthwatering acidity, this is a good choice for fish in a cream sauce. Drink now.",19.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"Hard to do, but almost all the fruit has been driven off from this most fruity of all grapes. What's left is concentrated and unctuous but excessively mineral, giving an impression of unbalance.",40.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"Delicate and dainty, this pretty selection boasts soft aromas and flavors of white cherry, bergamot tea, orange rind and hard peach. Light weight and refreshing, the lively acidity keeps the palate brisk and the fruit flavors fresh.",11.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé
"Full of firm tannins, this Juliénas shows solid structure and ripe red fruits. The fine acidity should help the wine age, and the juicy, fruity character should appear after a year or more.",20.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"This aromatic, red-cherry flavored wine demonstrates the freshness of the year and the grape. It's a finely textured wine that is structured and accessible, with firm, dry tannins. It can be aged for 2–3 years.",22.00,Beaujolais,Gamay

"The top wine from Château de Sours, this is a rich, full-bodied Merlot that's piled high with ripe tannins and blackberry and bitter cherry flavors. Wood aging adds a complex feel, and this selection will certainly benefit from aging 3–4 years.",40.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"In an immediately attractive soft cushioned, perfumed style, this is ripe, buoyed with fresh strawberry juice and balancing fresh, almost sweet, acidity. The wine is smooth, layering the light tannins with the intense fruits.",75.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Initially, the wine appears soft, with a noticeable layer of wood. The yellow fruit comes slowly through the spice, adding fruit richness. At the end, a burst of refreshing acidity finishes the wine with a lift. Worth aging for 2–3 years. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",38.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A big, muscular wine, powered with great rich wafts of black fruits, red plums and dense tannins. Maybe the wood element is just out of balance at this stage, giving a caramel flavor, but this should pass and the fruit and structure remain. One of a range of numbered, limited bottlings from Labouré-Roi.",48.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Marked by scents of leather, spice and prune, this earthy red lacks a bit of freshness.",10.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This beautiful wine is austere at this very young stage. But what pent-up power—the richness comes from glorious ripe fruit, tempered with a core of steel and wrapped with pure lemon, apricot and toast flavors. Age for 10 years at least.",430.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A ripe, toasty wine, very buttery. It has rich, almost sweet yellow fruit balanced with a wonderful mineral texture. The wine, of course, is still very young, but shows its future as being rounded and opulent. The acidity that holds it all together shows in the finish.",550.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Darker in color than a rosé, this Clairet is fruity with ripe strawberry fruit. But it does seem heavily laced with caramel as well as some tannins and spice.",12.00,Bordeaux,Rosé
A thin wine that is all dry tannins and not enough fruit. It is lightweight with just a hint of juiciness.,30.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This funky rosé shows an overly ripe and mushy red fruit character of muddled red berries, plum and banana. Full and somewhat flabby in the mouth with a fleeting finish.",11.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé
"A vanilla-dominated wine, ripe and broad, with a powerful sense of richness. This is certainly for food, missing the freshness but with a great swathe of sweet fruit.",19.00,Provence,Rosé
"It is less and less common to see the traditional bulbous Provençal bottle, but this simple and attractive wine fits well inside. It has touches of pink grapefruit to go with the wild strawberry in a great fruity burst.",25.00,Provence,Rosé
"Rich wine, lifted by delicious acidity that gives open fruit over pear and juice flavors. The wine has a fine texture of apple skins, giving a crisp aftertaste.",16.00,Provence,White_Blend
"All tannin, this wine is missing fruit, although the acidity hints at some fading freshness. It is tough and dry, not offering much real pleasure.",15.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Oxidative, with unusual aromas but a more typical profile in the mouth, with rose, lanolin and lychee flavor. Off-dry but balanced. Drink up.",22.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"This selection is named after the cherry trees that border the vineyard, and it's not too much of a stretch of the imagination to find a red cherry flavor in the wine. Red berry fruits are there as well, backed up by dry, firm tannins.",17.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"Dark and extracted, this has firm, dry tannins. It's hard edged, but the potential of the black currant fruit is apparent. Give this structured wine at least five years for the rich fruit to surface.",15.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A mint- and spice-flavored wine, this has concentrated tannins that structure the black plum and berry fruits. The flavors are rich, and the dense texture promises several years of aging.",35.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Bright and fruity, this blend of Duras, Braucol and Syrah comes with a spice note and a firm edge of tannins. It is rich and intensely fruity, with notes of black cherries and berries complementing each other. The acidity and firm finish suggest it will age for 3–4 years.",18.00,Southwest_France,Red_Blend
"This wood-aged wine has richness, toastiness and a concentration of pink grapefruit and fresh kiwi flavors. It's full and it shows some herbaceousness. It needs to age for 3–4 years.",35.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend

"Saga Pegot is a gorgeous single-block expression of Syrah, aged 14 months in French oak. The oak is present and forward, lending a great decadence to the wine by way of sweet wood and strong mocha chacteristics among the black berry and cherry fruit core. Additional nuances of licorice stick, crushed purple florals and thin mint add depth to the lush mouth.

"Dark and tannic, this is a wine with a dense core that influences the stalky, plum skin-flavored fruit. The tannins remain closed, dry and tight, and this wine needs at least two years to open out.",63.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Dark in color, a bright red plum and fresh berry wine, the fruit flavors layered over a significant toast element. The wood gives the tannin, but the wine is already coming together, offering some of the proper Volnay velvet texture.",61.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Friendly, accessible, this wine exudes white fruits and soft acidity. It is not heavy, but more finely balanced, the structure coming from fruit skins rather than the hint of wood. With its juicy acidity, the wine finishes with a tasty flourish. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd.",36.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A rich layer of ripe red plums characterizes this wine immediately. The fruit is spiced with wood, but dominated by fresh acidity, followed by tight tannins and a youthful brightness. Give it 2–3 years.",99.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"While the wine has a steely edge to it, it also has delicious, warm, full yellow fruits, juicy acidity and wood that fits well within the overall structure. For aging over 3–4 years.",60.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"From a producer that is closely linked to Salon Champagne, it's no coincidence that this Blanc de Blancs is the best of the Delamotte range. It is crisp, lemony, with a touch of toast and a mature finish.",95.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Ripe, smooth and strawberry-flavored, a full-in-the-mouth wine with just a touch of caramel.",15.00,Provence,Rosé
"An attractively balanced wine bringing the freshness of pink grapefruit acidity alongside red cherries. The acidity is present, but not too dominant. A great summer food rosé.",27.00,Provence,Rosé
"Soft wine, the acidity subservient to the rich red fruits and almost sweet vanilla. There is a firm touch of spice giving a fine twist to this ripe wine.",35.00,Provence,Rosé
"Fine, fresh currant flavors topped with citrus are found on a wine whose aromas are all Sauvignon Blanc. There is a weighty element to give body, but the wine is mainly bright and fresh.",16.00,Southwest_France,Chardonnay-Sauvignon
"Dense fruit sets this wine off well. It has structure, ripe black plum juice and cranberry fruits, followed by sweet tannins as well as balancing acidity. The ensemble of fruit and tannins promises some aging—maybe 3 years, but with its richness it is drinkable now.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Initial big, tough tannins are then cut through with fresh fruits, plums and black berries. There is some spice here, and maybe the tannins remain hard-edged, but in 2–3 years this will soften out to give a big, bold, rounded wine.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This is the second wine of Château de Mercuès, and it has some of the same concentration and tannins as the first wine, without the huge and powerful structure. It will develop its black cherry and spice flavors relatively quickly, to yield a ready-to-drink wine in 2–3 years.",16.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"A wine with some depth, this is layered with fine tannins. The acidity and red cherry flavor are held up by its firm structure. It's also fruity enough to be consumed now.",16.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"A blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Loin de l'Oeil, this is ripe, fruity and perfumed. It has an attractive floral character, with flavors of toast and hedgerow. It's ready to drink, but it could age.",15.00,Southwest_France,White_Blend
"This wine is named after a windmill on the Conti family property. It is rich, with a spicy new-wood flavor. While it has plenty of structure, the acidity is subdued.",45.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Made using fruit sourced from vineyards on the highest terrace above the Tarn River, this fruity wine is made to be consumed young. It has a touch of minerality and some firm tannins, but the red berry fruit and flower note is already attractive. A blend of Négrette, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec.",14.00,Southwest_France,Red_Blend
"This blend of Merlot, Malbec and Tannat is soft and rich. With its ripe plum fruit, rich texture and soft, dusty tannins, this feels full on the palate. The finish shows crisp acidity.",18.00,Southwest_France,Red_Blend
"Tough tannins set the scene for this firm and extracted wine, giving it a smokiness and a touch of bitter fruit. However, the wine has the weight to support the tannins, and it hints at future juicy fruit. Keep this for at least five years.",35.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The lightest of the dessert wines made by Claude Loustalot, this is fruity, fragrant and medium sweet, with refreshing acidity. The crisp texture combines hints of honey and apricot jam. Drink now.",23.00,Southwest_France,Gros_Manseng
"Soft and already approachable, this is a red-fruited wine, with ripe, well-integrated tannins and juicy acidity. It's round, fruity and ready to drink.",16.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"There's a slight cobbler-like character to the nose of this wine, with mealy scents of peach bubble gum, banana and strawberry. The palate is more linear, with a pronounced line of acidity and flavors of green banana and orange citrus.",13.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé
"A fruit-forward rosé, this offers aromas and flavors of juicy strawberry and cherry  that are mixed with accents of white-flower and menthol. A hint of white-tea astringency adds texture to the palate, finishing dry and clean.",12.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé
"A rich and concentrated, yellow fruit-dominated wine. This is white Burgundy at its most opulent, dense and generous. The wood is sweet, reinforcing the delicious character of this wine. Age for 4–5 years.",62.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Full and buttery, as befits a Meursault, the wine also has a fine-textured acidity, spice and toast. It is rich, although with a crisp citrus edge that balances out the ripe melon and honey flavor. Ready to drink, but could age for a few years.",49.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Rich, intense red-fruited wine, soft and voluptuous. The tannins are folded into the ripe fruits, giving a very approachable feel. The acidity is prominent at this stage but should soften in a year or two, and the wine is certainly worth aging.",55.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This Poruzots offers a restrained version of Meursault, very structured, its texture severe and tight. Apple skin and green plum fruits go with the dry toast character. Age for a year for more ripe flavors to emerge.",108.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"H&B;'s 2008 Faugères is rich and complex, with herbal garrigue aromas of lavender and laurel framed against the solid ripe dark berry and cherry fruit core. The mouth is brisk and lively, with vibrant acidity lifting the dark fruit flavors and carrying through to the chocolate- and espresso-flecked close. Good now, but hold for another two to five years for even greater enjoyment.",39.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Rich, creamy wood-aged wine that shows pear, apple and toast flavors ane even a hint of honey. Smooth and textured, it has fine final spice and acidity to add further interest.",35.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A heavily oaked wine that needs time for the toast to integrate. It does have the black fruit structure to back it up, so expect this complex wine to develop pleasurably over the next 5–6 years.",42.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Ripe, rich and soft, this is an opulent wine from a warm year. The acidity is there, masked by toast, apricot and melon flavors. It is already drinkable, likely to continue to age over 3–4 years.",70.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Smoky, new-wood aromas and flavors cloak the black berry fruit in this wine. It has a hard edge at the moment, like concentrated wood juice. But there is fruit there, so give the wine two years and those powerful, brooding fruits will come through.",261.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Bouchard Aîné's whites have progressed well in quality, and this soft, plump Chassagne-Montrachet is a good example. It has weight, a finely judged feel for toast, which fits well with the white peach and spice flavors. The finish is full but fresh. Imported by Boisset America.",80.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Freshly fruity initially, this wine slowly reveals some tight and firm tannins that go deep into the rich plum and spice flavors. It is structured as well as fleshy, a balanced wine that finishes with bright acidity.",52.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"It is sometimes forgotten that Chassagne-Montrachet also produces red wines. Louis Latour's wine presents a fine structure, soft and fresh acidity and ripe, jammy berry flavors. There is a good core of dryness that suggests aging for 2–3 years.",25.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Granite soil with strata of quartz gives this wine its intense texture, very structured and tight. It's at a young stage, the red currant and dark cherry fruits integrating with the firm character of the wine. Keep for two years.",21.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"Louise is always a light wine, almost feathery, and this 1999, now mature, maintains this style. It is delicate, its acidity just touched with toast and hints of citrus zest underneath. It doesn't have a long future, so enjoy now.",180.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"The 18 months' barrel aging has given a strong toasty wood taste that smothers the black plum fruits. Six months could see better integration, but the juiciness is missing in the bone-dry tannins.",25.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"The second wine of Fonplégade is soft, gentle, the tannins firmly surprised behind a velvet texture and ripe fruit. There is a jammy, sweet quality to the wine, and it is ready to drink now.",44.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"High toast and burnt wood are initially off-putting. The tannins in the wine are also on the smoky side. However, there is fruit here, offering some balance in this powerful, dry wine, and giving some blackberry juiciness, which gives relief from the intensity of the wood.",28.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Under the ownership of American Stephen Adams, this estate is showing promise. The wine is finely structured, a smoky bacon element mingling well with fresh red plum and firm tannins. The core is dry, solid, showing wood, finishing with vivid minerality and acidity.",17.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Black plums fresh acidity combine with a good weight from dusty tannins and a good juicy undertow. The wine suggests a property on the way up, a marked improvement on previous vintages, with balance ripeness and aging potential.",37.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Round, ripe and fruity, this has soft tannins that accentuate the cherry flavor and give a hint of dryness. The acidity and brilliant fruit are delicious, finishing with a bright red-fruit flavor.",20.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"From the eastern slopes of the hill of Brouilly, this attractive, open and fruity selection shows a fine red-fruit character that's laced with fresh acidity. It has a firm structure, which creates a solid base for the fruitiness. Drink now.",16.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"This is herbaceous, but it also has a ripe yellow-fruit character. It is fresh and crisp, with a great depth of flavor. Its bright acidity and tight-textured finish make this a food wine.",20.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"This is full of crisp, herbaceous flavors of apple, grapefruit and lime. It has weight and concentration, with some richness to its freshness. Acidity cuts through on the finish. Age this for 2–3 years.",18.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"This shows the fruity side of Cabernet Franc. No wood aging, just red fruits, spice and stalky tannins, with a hint of smokiness and a light structure. Drink from 2015.",13.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"The relatively unknown Pezerolles Vineyard is at the far northern end of Pommard, touching Beaune above Les Epenots. It produces wine that seems softer than many Pommards, with rich fruit, the tannins firm but definitely playing second fiddle. It is the smoky plum fruit with just a dash of acidity that makes this immensely pleasing.",90.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A big, jammy wine with full ripe strawberries and sweet, juicy blackberries. The tannins are soft, and the acidity plays a balancing supporting role. Not for aging, but delicious to drink in the next few years.",55.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Starts off a bit funky, with scents of tar and rubber, but quickly rights itself and shows rich dark fruit with hints of hickory smoke. Flavors lean toward black cherry, but also feature smoke, grilled meat and licorice. It's medium- to full-bodied, with a firm structure that bodes well for cellaring. Try after 2012.",35.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Light in color, this rejoices in its perfumed character as much as its fruit. There is a heady smoky aroma, while the palate shows a leaner character. The fruit flavors of red berries are given an extra dimension by the smoky wood and the meaty edge.",90.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Reasonably priced for a Châteauneuf-du-Pape, the 2005 Vieux Lazaret displays lovely kirsch aromas balanced by subtle spice, remarkably pure fruit flavors and a rich, creamy texture. This full-bodied effort is drinking well now, and should continue to do so for at least 10 years.",31.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"With smoky aromas, this starts out as an enticing wine. On the palate, the fruit is surprisingly soft for a Nuits-St-Georges, with the wine's evident structure showing an open character, edged with wood and red plum and currant flavors. The dry tannins give shape, but do not dominate this big wine.",115.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Maranges, south of the Côte de Beaune, is still finding its place and style. This wine, pleasingly firm Pinot Noir with solid tannins, may give a clue, with its slightly rustic, bitter edge and sweet black fig flavors. The acidity is sweet, coming through the bright red fruits. Imported by Robert Kacher Imports.",33.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Warm, soft, green plum-flavored wine, stiffened with toast and almonds. There is a mineral core, the tannins from pear skins offering spice as well as structure. The finish is more on the crisp side, a burst of freshness. Imported by Robert Kacher Imports.",48.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Rich, concentrated, its creamy flavor complementing the ripe yellow fruits, this is a well-made, drink-now wine on the fruity side of Chablis: forward, just a thread of texture hinting at minerality. Imported by Cellar Door Selections.",26.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A real strawberry-flavored wine, full of soft sweetness and pure fresh flavors. The wine bursts with fruit, the tannins just enough but in definite second place. Obviously not a wine for aging, but a pleasure to drink now. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",40.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"While it's light, this Marsannay, from the northernmost appellation of the Côte de Nuits, gives warm, soft pleasure. The fruit has fresh berry and sweet jam flavors, followed by a layer of dryness that is not excessive and an attractive lively finish.",19.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Delicious Pinot Noir, all juicy plums, strawberries and the freshest acidity. It has elegant, ripe fruit given depth by soft tannins and a final burst of red fruits. Drink now and over the next 2–3 years.",30.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Perhaps better known for his Côte-Rôties, Pierre Gaillard is obviously comfortable working with schist. Transhumance is an intense and complex wine, with assertive notes of kirsch, sweet smoke, wild game and garrigue accents of thyme, rosemary and violet. Rich and lush in the mouth, the texture is like crushed velvet and the finish evolves from a dark fruit blast to sweet vanilla bean and finally ending on a smoked cedar and spice note.",25.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Now at its best, this is a wine showing tannins, dry raisins as well as tense acidity. It is mature, ripe, definitely ready for drinking. It has secondary flavors of prunes, wood and smokiness, while the dryness at the core suggests it will not mature much longer.",119.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Although this is not the newest release from Hecht & Bannier, it is drinking nicely now, with mature notes of kirsch and black currant backed by accents of sweet spice, crushed violets and soft leather. Though aged, the mouth is still full and big with gripping tannins and a firm structure. The finish is long, evoking flavors of cocoa-dusted blackberries and peppery spice. Drink now–2014.",39.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Structured white fruits, this is a complex and concentrated wine. Toast, apple and apricot flavors are blended with herbs and intense acidity. Spice from the wood shows on the finish.",28.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"While the style is soft, full of yellow fruit richness, the wine also show an excellent concentrated texture. The fresh fruit is integrated into this more complex style. The aftertaste shows some softness, but the wine can certainly age for several years.",92.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is showing a mature, browning color. The palate echoes that it is just beginning to dry out, although for the next year or two it will still be a delicious, mature wine. The tannins are dark, with some sweetness as well as final acidity.",240.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A selection from different parcels in the Château de Fuissé vineyard, this is a rich wine, initially soft, then showing a more textured character. It has weight, concentration, the wood adding another dimension to an already complex wine.",39.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Ripe, sweet-fruited wine, its red berry fruits and opulent tannins giving a rounded feel. There is, as well, a good structure composed of acidity, licorice and wood. It needs 2–3 years still to really develop all its depth of flavor.",68.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A beautifully ripe and rounded wood-aged wine. It brings out all the opulence of Meursault while keeping a tight, textured element as counterpoint. The wood flavors are beginning to blend into the lychee and peach flavors, promising an even richer experience in a few months.",46.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Heady and concentrated notes of blackberry, cherry and plum are graced with additional glimmers of lavender and thyme. The layered fruit continues in the velvety mouth, and licorice stick, clove and nutmeg spice accents carry well into the finish. A nice expression with great balance; drink now–2014.",20.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A firmly tannic wine packed with dark fruits and a velvet texture. Not as powerful as some vintages, although all the firm structure is there. The acidity, red fruits and freshness finish the wine with a lift.",120.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A concentrated wine, full of firm tannins as well as delicious red cherry fruits. The wine has weight, richness, structure, definitely for aging, while retaining the open fruit of delicious Gamay.",20.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"This is Bouchard's hallmark Beaune, a blend from different premier cru vineyards. The wine is dense, firm and dominated by dark tannins, which offer good aging potential. The sweet tomato acidity and black berry fruits merge with a noticeable flavor of wood—the combo still needs time to fully balance out. Wait at least four years.",40.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Strawberry aromas are out in force here. On the palate, the wine is more structured, with some dark tannins, but its fruit is still right out there, with sweetness as well as richness. The texture is velvet smooth, leavened with acidity.",65.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Smoky, chewy, with firm, dark tannins, this wine shows power mitigated with elegance. It is certainly solid, complex, the rich blackberry flavors layered with smokiness as well as tight acidity. Worth aging.",75.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Run by the Gonnet family of Font de Michelle in Châteauneuf-du-Pape, this is a wonderfully supple, ready-to-drink Côtes-du-Rhône that's more charming than big and hulking. Sandalwood, perfume and spice aromas lead into cherry-raspberry fruit backed by dusty, earthy notes and layers of spice.",19.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Rich, with flavors of stewed fruits, red plums, sweetness and softness. It's certainly a super-ripe wine, maybe too obviously rich, but immediately delicious.",55.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A deliciously refreshing wine that bursts with citrus freshness, rounded out by white currant and pear flavors. The wood hints are attractively subtle, giving a wine of poise, elegance. Age for six months for it to show at its best. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",40.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A core of tannins, surmounted by fresh red berry fruits give this wine an attractive balance. It is not as powerful as you should expect from Gevrey, with light color and fruits, finishing with vivid acidity.",47.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Even for a Meursault, this is exceptionally rounded, plump. The wine maybe misses out on freshness, but it compensates with the spice, almond and sweet white berry and pear flavors. The end is all spice and toast. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",51.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"There is a definite caramel and toffee character to this wine, sitting over ripe melon and yellow peach. The texture is dominated by wood, but still shows plenty of creamy baked apples. Good, fine concentration on the finish. Imported by Palm Bay International.",32.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Despite its bitter edge, this is a warm wine, bursting with red berries and fresh acidity. A good, dry core of tannins promises some aging. On the finish, a layer of well-judged wood joins the solid fruit.",48.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A richly fruity wine, its tannins comfortably entrenched in a plump structure. Wood flavors are in the background, giving extra richness. With its dark plum fruits, acidity and tannins, the wine will age well.",32.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir

"An intensely fresh wine, with considerable acidity offering a lively edge to what is a serious rosé. It's definitely for food, its fruits given a firm texture by the lemon zest and acidity.",26.00,Provence,Rosé
"A taut, mineral wine with a domiNAce of Chardonnay to give the crispest citrus and a very textured feel. Definitely dry, the wine, not from a classic vintage year, seems still young and all fruit, so it would be worth aging for 3–4 years.",51.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This walled vineyard has produced a surprisingly tannic, if impressive, wine for a Savigny in this vintage. It has a dark and firm character, the red berry fruits just beginning to break through the firm and dry tannins. It needs 4–5 years' aging.",42.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"There is a definite feeling of maturity here. The wine has a fine tang of fruit along with toast, vanilla and hints of grapefruit and apple. This opulent Champagne is ready to drink now.",100.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A soft style of Sauvignon, hinting at tropical fruit, but guarding its fresh, green, herbaceous character. The wine is ultrafresh and with its texture of fruit skins is a likely wine for food. Screwcap.",12.00,Southwest_France,Sauvignon_Blanc
"From one of the top estates in Provence, this is a rich wine, packed with fruits. It has a layer of spice and caramel, and an edge of fennel and herbs. For food.",17.00,Provence,Rosé

"Huge, rich, flaunting its opulence and ripeness, this super cuvée from Château Lagarosse, powers with black stewed plums, heavy tannins, layers of wood and spice. The acidity saves it from going over the top, but only just.",36.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"From the far eastern edge of Bordeaux, this wine offers delicious, fresh fruits structured by light tannins. Its black currant flavors are right up front, pleasure without complications.",15.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Soft, sensuous, this is a wine that appeals straight away to the senses. The red fruits float over a soft texture of sweet tannins, leaving a juicy, succulent texture. While it is not a powerful wine, it offers all the delicious characters of Pinot Noir.",80.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"While the winery's Notre Passion bottling is 50-50 Grenache and Syrah, Les Promesses gives Grenache more weight (70%), blending it with 25% Syrah and 5% Mourvèdre. The result is a similarly silky, charming wine with hints of clove and cracked pepper in its raspberry-cherry fruit. Drink now–2012.",17.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This limited-production gem (90 cases imported) speaks distinctly of the northern Rhône and the Syrah grape. It starts off with cracked pepper, anise and a hint of hickory smoke, then delivers cassis, hickory and licorice flavors. It's full-bodied while retaining an elegant structure and finishes long, buffered by soft tannins. Drink now–2020.",50.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Shows the power and intensity of the 2005 vintage, packing in plenty of weight and tannin. The black cherry and plum flavors are a bit monolithic but pure, picking up a hint of tar on the long, astringent finish. Hold 3–5 years. Imported by International Gourmet.",56.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A rounded, mouthfilling wine. At the beginning, it seems very soft, but then it is possible to discern rich tannins through the concentrated red fruits and black plums. The acidity is there all the time, a fine counterpoint to the seductive, rich fruits and dry tannins.",79.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This ripe wine rolls around the mouth, showing fresh acidity, but also black plums and bitter chocolate which gives spice. It's an attractive wine with a soft personality, full of comfortable velvet folds.",40.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Soft, rich, but still with fine acidity to keep the freshness, this is a white fruit- and citrus-flavored wine that broadens well in the mouth. The fruit is ripe, hinting at almonds, with just a light toast edge. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd.",29.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Rich and fruity, this wine combines jammy red fruits with pure acidity. The main impression is sweetness followed by generous dollops of black cherry and spice. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd.",28.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Initially spicy, this wine then develops an awkward barnyard character that is hard to shake off. The tannins are firm, dry, but sit at one side of the wine, leaving bitter fruit. This is a tough wine, not properly in balance.",108.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This firm, foursquare, solid wine shows the dry tannins of Nuits-St-Georges but also brings in dark plum and black cherry fruit flavors. The balance is there, with acidity adding to the mix and giving a bright, fresh finish.",69.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Smooth, creamy wine, with rounded white fruits that float easily over the judicious light toast flavor. The wine has some richness, but the mineral character of Chablis is there, giving the wine delicious fruit structure. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd.",33.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay

"A blend of 40% Syrah, 30% Grenache, 20% Carignan and 10% Mourvèdre aged in French oak for 12 months, this wine exhibits great depth of flavors against a tight structure.

"Scents of plum, orange rind, banana and a touch of mentholated herb unfold on the nose, while the palate offers fruit-skin flavors of plum and cherry, lending a slightly tannic structure.",15.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé
"A fruity and fragrant selection, with upfront aromas of ripe strawberries, banana and peaches and cream. There's a bit more tension on the palate, with bracing acidity and flavors of small, tart red berries and white cherry.",11.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé
"Importer and Master Sommelier Fran Kysela uses the Maison du Midi label for lots of Rhône wines he selects to bring into the U.S. This effort, from Plan de Dieu, is seriously intense, full-bodied and firmly tannic, showing the character of the vintage. The plummy fruit is powerful, fighting through the tannins on the finish. Try it young with rare beef, or put it away for a few years and see if the tannins soften over time.",23.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This firm's top Crozes-Hermitage cuvée is the Domaine Raymond Roure, which sees plenty of new wood in its upbringing, to judge from its somewhat coarse vanilla and cedar notes. There is plenty of blackberry fruit lurking beneath, so hopefully this will come together in time. Try after 2010.",44.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Rich and also delicious, this is true Chambolle. The wine revels in its rich, ripe, soft fruits, its flavors of wild strawberries and plum jelly. Of course, there are tannins, a core of dryness, but the exuberant fruit dominates this already delicious wine.",95.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Rich, dense, powered by black plum, spice and smoky wood, the ripe fruits in this wine are as concentrated and opaque as the rich tannins. There is nothing held back. All the elements are larger than life, giving immediate pleasure, not for aging.",70.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"An intriguing wine, that offers ripe sweetness followed by an edgy rustic acidity. Is this a stage in its evolution? Probably, because the tannins promise aging and the intensely aromatic nature of the fruit points to a potentially fine wine. Just don't drink it yet.",55.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"The voluble, opinionated Jean-Luc Colombo has crafted a Cairanne that shows a lot of ripe Grenache character, offering scents akin to cherries, almond butter and almost peach or apricot. It's on the chunky side, with some dusty tannins on the finish, so you could drink it now or save it for a few years.",21.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Light, crisp, lemon-scented, with fresh apricots, pear juice and toast flavors. This is a wine that gives immediate pleasure, but with just a tight steeliness at the core to promise some aging. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",32.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Soft and gentle, a wine in a minor key, hinting at berry fruits and sweet acidity. It is easy on the palate, with its velvet texture and the lightest touch of tannin.",28.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Ripe, open, apricot and pineapple fruit flavors suffuse this open, generous wine. This is an easy appellation to appreciate, with citrus tastes and vanilla giving a sharp point to the more flattering fruits. Drink now, or keep for another year. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",21.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Rich, creamy Chardonnay, spiced with toasty wood, full of open, generous pear and sweet plum flavors. The wood is just right for the rich, soft fruit, adding a slight complexity. A final minerality gives added balance. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",16.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Heady but juicy Grenache dominates the blend of this wine, which also includes 30% Cinsault, 15% Syrah and 15% Mourvèdre. Concentrated deep fruit aromas of plum, blackberry and muddled boysenberry flood the nose, while a streak of minerality and moderate acidity keep things vibrant in the medium-weight mouth with a velour-like texture. Licorice and sweet spice stay well into the close.",29.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This Carignan-based blend with 25% Grenache is dense and concentrated, highlighting just how well the old Carignan vines from the region can express themselves. Ripe blueberry and boysenberry flavors are matched with medium-intense notes of bay, menthol, sweet bark and bittersweet chocolate. The silky mouth offers a round but balanced feel, with a nice mineral lift to the close.",25.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Slow to show its quality, with a little aeration this becomes a superripe wine, its wood element dominated by the intense tropical fruits. There is some balancing restraint in the citrus character, along with the acidity. Enjoy now.",54.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A seriously supple and creamy wine with character throughout. The nose is loaded with garrigue perfumes of thyme and bay leaves among the clean red apple and white melon aromas. Toast and soft spice mingle on the palate, with a soft honeyed flavor enduring through the long finish.",50.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,White_Blend
"Owned by the Sumeire family (like Château Maupague), this is fresh, brisk and crisp. And it shows a more serious side, with spice and cherry flavors coming through a tight apple skin texture.",25.00,Provence,Rosé
"The entry-level wine from Sacha Lichine's Château d'Esclans. It is soft, broad, with more caramel and spice than fruit. It is definitely a food, not an apéritif, wine.",20.00,Provence,Rosé
"Light pink/gold in color, this is an exotic ripe wine with melon and tropical fruit flavors underlined by toast. It is big, rich and mouthfilling.",20.00,Provence,White_Blend
"A full style of Sauvignon Blanc, offering white fruits as well as herbaceous citrus and gooseberry flavors. It is pure, clean, with the brightest acidity, finishing with a touch of almonds.",12.00,Southwest_France,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A smooth, wood-aged wine that shows ripe black berry fruits, already maturing. The soft tannins give a cushion of support, but the dominant factor in this wine is the easy, ready-to-drink maturity. The wine is named after the Irish 18 century founder of the property.",23.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"There is plenty of ripe fruit here, the richness of 2005 evident. The flavors are of ripe blackberry jam, red plums and a strong structure of sweet tannins. There is a fresh, acidity-driven juicy lift on the finish.",15.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A firm, ripe wine, with good sweet black currant fruit flavors. It is structured, but mainly showing fruit rather than tannins. There is a fine, fresh finish, hinting at wood.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"From a 34-acre property in the Entre-deux-Mers region, this wine shows how successful even the lesser lights of Bordeaux have been in 2005. It has richness, full cassis and ripe tannins. It is simple, relying on its fruit and its approachability, and succeeding admirably.",19.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Fresh aromas of red fruits are immediately attractive, but the wine also has weight, with some rich, smoky fruits, edges of tobacco and dried fruits. The tannins give a definite firm structure, but are well padded by wood and ripe fruits.",35.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"An easy and bright selection, this offers direct aromas and flavors of red currant, underripe strawberry and a touch of banana. The palate is light, with low-intensity flavors and a short, clean finish.",11.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé
"Maison Bouachon is an old négociant house based in Gigondas. It's now owned by the Skalli family who is trying to raise the level of the wines. This Côtes-du-Rhône cuvée is a promising effort, boasting plenty of black cherry fruit to go with hints of leather and game. The fruit shows a hint of sur-maturité, yet remains fresh, while the mouthfeel is round yet not unstructured. Drink now–2010, possibly longer.",17.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"After spending 18 months in oak, this is an unusually cedary Châteauneuf-du-Pape, its stewed fruit, plum pudding and spice flavors covered by a veneer of toast and vanilla. It's full bodied, plushly textured and undeniably appealing in a rather obvious, modern style. Imported by New Castle Imports, Inc.",38.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A rich wine, full of ripe red plums and sweet acidity. There is also a denser character, made up of concentrated tannins, dark wood and a structure that needs time to develop. In the end, the juicy acidity just bursts out of the glass, leaving a fresh, red berry fruit aftertaste.",70.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Alain Dugas, who is also the winemaker at Château La Nerthe in Châteauneuf-du-Pape, runs this estate, and he has turned out a concentrated, dark-fruited wine in the 2004 vintage. Black cherry and plum pick up hints of tree bark, coffee and earth on the firmly tannic finish. Drink 2010–2015.",20.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"In a soft-fruited, juicy style, crushed strawberry flavors ride over the light tannins. This is a fresh, medium-weight wine, finished with sweet acidity and a final, clear berry finish.",53.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Well-textured fruit—red plum skins, bright berries—floating on some tight tannins makes for good structure, the clean, fresh juicy flavors followed by a firm finish. Drink now, or keep for 1–2 years. Imported by Louis Latour Inc.",25.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A big, superripe wine that manages to combine this opulence with an edge of crisp acidity, keeping it well in balance. There are sweet peach and melon flavors followed by a touch of lime and toast, finishing rich and slightly spicy. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",41.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This, the second wine from Clos de la Maréchale, is light, very fresh, dusty in texture, the tannins held in suspension, with red plum and cranberry flavors.",47.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"With only 30 cases imported, this clean and vibrant wine might be a tough find. The bouquet is surprisingly bright, with notes of garrigue and peppery spice dominating the plum, cherry and fresh fig aromas. Smooth and silky in the mouth, soft tannins and a mineral streak make this surprisingly approachable now.",45.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Relatively rich in character, with toast and yeast flavors offering a contrast to the more tropical fruit flavors. There is dry spice and finely balanced acidity that offer a further dimension to this full-bodied wine.",20.00,Provence,Rosé
"Hecht & Bannier tends to favor a blend based on Syrah and Mourvèdre, here 55% and 35% respectively, with a small addition of Carignan to add lively spice and vibrant acidity. Aromas of rosemary and thyme sprigs spice up the ripe fruit core, while the medium-length finish offers a lovely dusting of black pepper on the end. Drink now–2015.",39.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A blend of Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier, this is a rich Champagne. It has layers of red currant fruits and intense acidity. There is some toast coming through as this wine has aged.",59.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This blend of 40% Syrah, 35% Grenache and 25% Mourvèdre takes some time to fully express itself in the glass, with soft scents of licorice root, red cherry, raspberry and a touch of sweet orange oil. Bright and fresh in the mouth with juicy red fruit flavors infused by a mineral twang. Drink now–2015.",20.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"One of the best-selling Champagnes in the world, this Brut has a great fruity character, full of green apples with tangy acidity and an finish that is soft while crisp.",36.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A fine expression of mineral Sauvignon Blanc, very textured with green herb and fruit skins giving a tense shape to a wine that could age. It's finely balanced, the refreshing acidity cutting right through the wine.",30.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Plenty of wood aromas, but the palate combines the wood notes with smoky acidity, textured green plum and vanilla flavors with a refreshing acidity. There's a tang here: a wine that has bursts of great fruit to go with the wood.",55.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Fresh strawberry aromas set the scene for a bright, red berry flavored wine. It has vibrant, vivid acidity and exotic perfumes. The tannins, however, do suggest that this is a bigger, tougher wine than the fruit offers. Over the next few months, it is likely to fill out and become more dense.",70.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A big, round, generous wine with strawberry flavors that are ripe as well as soft. It is very approachable, its dense character coming from delicious fruits that pile layer upon layer on top of each other. It's hard to find the acidity in all this plumpness, but it is there, and creates a fresh finish.",60.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This is an opulent, delicious, rounded wine. It has fresh berry acidity, but that is only a part of the sweet red fruits and cranberry flavors. The texture is ripe, just edged with soft tannins.",52.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This wine represents a round, soft style of Crozes-Hermitage and is for immediate pleasure. Rich black cherry fruit is accented by subtle wood spice and anise notes chime in on the almost lush finish. Drink now–2012.",25.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Big and burly, here is power from Pinot Noir. The tannins are firm, spiced with dark black fruits, rolling luxuriously around the mouth. A spike of acidity gives the wine some freshness, but it remains a big, plump wine.",60.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"One of the most famous Crozes-Hermitage bottlings, the 2005 Domaine de Thalabert is a little tough and unyielding right now, but shows promise in its persistent, peppery finish. It starts off with gamy, leathery notes and hickory smoke, all backed by crisp blackberry fruit and ample tannin. Try after 2012.",43.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Tense and dark, this has firm, dry tannins that overlay black plum skin and black fig flavors. The wine shows richness but also a foursquare solid structure and weight that is balanced by a final sweet, satisfying juicy acidity.",70.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"The smokiness that is apparent in many Chanson wines from this vintage is the dominant character in the bouquet of this big, burly wine. It has richness, a solid structure and some good, dense tannins. At the same time, the acidity reminds us of the freshness of the richest Pinot Noir.",73.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A beautifully perfumed wine, not powerful, but delicate and delicious. The fruit, as with all of Gilles Jayer's wines, is very pure, its raspberry flavors piercing through the tight tannins and prominent acidity. This is a fine expression of elegant, fresh Pinot Noir.",59.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"There's a wild streak to this wine, with prominent aromas of cured meat and fresh savory herbs paired with cherry and strawberry scents. The mouth is quite filling and lush, with beautiful sweet spice and chewy bark flavors adding character to the close. 80% Syrah and 20% Carignan; ready to drink now.",19.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"With its rounded texture and smooth wood and yellow fruits, this is a generous wine. It has weight and some richness tempered with acidity and a prominent apple skin character. In another few months, the wine's richness will show better.",45.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A tank-aged wine made from the estate's younger wines, with fresh acidity and sweet berry fruits. It has a soft structure, offering freshness to go with the dusty tannins.",17.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"The blend of Cabernet Franc and Tannat allows this wine to be released young and for the tannins to be accessible. It's young and fresh, Nouveau in its style, going for bright berry fruits and lively acidity.",11.00,Southwest_France,Tannat-Cabernet
"Definite juiciness here, although the wine has a light and fresh character. The acidity and tannins are there to give the berry fruit a boost.",13.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"The weight here is palpable, sweet peach and strawberry going with richness. There is enough acidity, but the pepper edge is less attractive.",25.00,Provence,Rosé
"Pommery's nonvintage is very much in the light, feathery house style. It is a wine that floats in the mouth, aided by a fine mousse. The finish is soft, with delicate acidity.",55.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Round and soft, very much in the style of warm-hearted Brouilly. The wine has a layer of tannins, while it's the delicious red berry fruits that dominate. Ripe, full and ready to drink.",18.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"With a crisp nose of brisk green apple accented by lime rind and yellow florals, this is a beautiful Limoux Chard with great expression. Mineral notes drive the palate, with ripe apple and lime juice flavors lingering through the softly spiced finish.",20.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"A great expression of the terroir, this rosé made from 50% Syrah, 40% Grenanche and 10% Cinsault is loaded with garrigue accents (lavender and thyme) among the fresh strawberry and cherry fruit core. Clean and zippy on the finish with a lingering soft spice accent.",20.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé
"Produced in a light style, this fresh, mint- and berry-flavored wine is Merlot-dominated from younger vines at Château Haut Beyzac. It is poised, with fine acidity, blackberry jam flavors and soft tannins.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Fresh wine, with a layer of wood that smoothes out the crisp black currant fruits and stalky tannins. The acidity is certainly very present, but the wine does have some richness and depth of juicy flavor.",15.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This is a style of wine that offers a blockbuster view of Bordeaux. It is full of dark extracted fruits, brooding tannins, dark plum juice and a burnt feeling that comes from alcohol. In its style, it goes for excess.",35.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A firm, tight wine that is showing black currants, some bitter chocolate and a pronounced element of acidity. The tannins are well-defined, giving a firm, rich underlay to the final, fresh burst of juicy black fruits.",18.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Perfumed and highly aromatic, this wine features plenty of dried spices and sandalwood on the nose, then cherry fruit and a touch of adhesive bandage on the palate. The silky texture in the mouth is a pleasure, suggesting early consumption. Imported by New Castle Imports, Inc.",40.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"There is great purity of fruit here. The wine that shows the freshest of strawberries, and is given a jelly flavor by their sweetness. The tannins are a core of dryness and blend satisfyingly with the acidity and fruits. For such a humble appellation, this is an impressive wine.",52.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This wine is firm and tannic, with a dark, bitter edge. It needs to age, because at the moment, the dry tannins are dominant. There are flavors of ripe cranberries, blueberries and dried figs, which are still working to assert themselves against the dry core.",65.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"The price of this cuvée has risen considerably over the years, but at least the quality has remained high. The 2005 offers bold black cherry, plum and licorice elements on the nose, plenty of weight and richness on the palate and an intense, spice-driven finish. It may be consumed now, but should also evolve pleasantly over the next 10–15 years.",30.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"It has the suppleness associated with Beaune, but the wine seems to lack depth of flavor. There is an attractive freshness and dry tannins, but it's all surface. Enjoy now, but not for aging.",44.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Ripe and full-bodied, this is burly Chardonnay, hinting at new world softness but without losing sight of its roots in Burgundy. There is acidity and a light toast, but they are sideshows to the rich fruit. Imported by Louis Latour Inc.",19.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Firm, mineral, tight wine, given an extra dimension by pear skins and a touch of caramel. The wine is impressive for its appellation, offering a structured, terroir-driven character. Imported by Louis Latour Inc.",15.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Rich for a Chablis, its sweet fruit rounded with currants and ripe yellow fruits. There is just a touch of caramel, but the rich fruit carries all before it, only hinting at Chablis minerality. Imported by Palm Bay International.",45.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Monnot does a good job with his simplest white. The wine is crisp, fresh, its light green fruits smoothed out with some creamy vanilla and almond paste. It is bright, the acidity giving a delicious final lift. Imported by Robert Kacher Imports. Editors' Choice.",28.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A rich and fruity wine with an attractive layer of tannins to go with the bright red cherry and damson flavors. The fruit is delicious, succulent, finishing with fine acidity.",27.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A wood-aged, rich and full wine, benefiting from the year and giving out fine perfumes, rich tannins and dark berry flavors. It's a wine with enough power to age further, already a solid pleasure to drink.",10.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"A delicious cream and lemon Chardonnay. It is rich, while still presenting a more steely core that comes from the chalk soil. The wine finishes with more tropical fruit flavors, pineapple and yellow peaches.",29.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Tart, fresh and a bit chunky and rustic, this blend of 60% Syrah, 20% Grenache and 20% Cinsaut features bold lime notes, scouring acidity and hints of crushed stone. Drink now.",15.00,Provence,Rosé
"The Grassa family's original blend is still a delicious,  light wine. Its fresh bright citrus acidity combines with an apple skin structure to give a great apéritif and shellfish wine. Screwcap.",9.00,Southwest_France,Ugni_Blanc-Colombard
"One of the many labels owned by the Grassa family of Domaine du Tariquet, this is so light and fresh that it just floats across the palate. It is citrus-crisp, with a tight apple skin texture. Great for apéritifs. Screwcap.",10.00,Southwest_France,White_Blend
"Part of a range of young wines produced by Mas del Perié. This is bright and fruity, relying on black berry fruits, soft tannins and a vivid juicy character. The dusty tannins supply a light amount of structure.",19.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"Pink in color, this strawberry-flavored rosé is fresh, crisp, with some caramel. The acidity of 2007 works to the benefit of a summer-drinking rosé like this.",12.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"For a 2003, this seems rather lean. The red fruits are turning mature now, and leaving some astringency behind. The wine is becoming herbal, with green pepper acidity. It's pleasant to drink, but is unlikely to develop.",24.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Despite a hefty dose of Grenache (60%), this is a dark, forboding wine, loaded with earthy notes and a full, firm, somewhat stern mouthfeel. It's impressive for its concentration and clearly needs time in the bottle, but it's unclear if it will ever offer truly hedonistic drinking. Imported by International Gourmet Corp.",20.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Made from Pinot Noir, this light rosé comes from a region just west of Chablis. It has a pretty, light orange pink color, while the taste is very crisp, bursting with red currant fruits. A delicious summer wine with food. Screwcap.",13.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"The most accessible of Paul Jaboulet Aîné's Crozes cuvées, the 2005 Les Jalets offers smoky, herbal, peppery aromatics, crisp pomegranate fruit and silky   tannins on the finish. It's a solid introduction to Crozes-Hermitage in an early-maturing style.",23.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"There's a new Jaboulet in town. Actually, this is the same family that put Paul Jaboulet Aîné on the map, but they've sold that company off and have started small again. The 2005 Crozes-Hermitage is a medium-bodied, juicy, fruity wine powered by plums and blackberries. There's ample concentration and persistence, it just needs more complexity.",28.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Better known for its Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Beaurenard's CdR represents better value. Hints of sandalwood and briary-herbal nuances accent ripe black cherries in the medium-weight wine. The satiny texture leads into a dry finish lined with fine-grained tannins. Drink now–2012. Imported by New Castle Imports.",15.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"At first glance, this medium-bodied wine seems overly astringent, with crisp acids accentuating the firm tannins. But give it some time in the glass, and the black cherry-plum-cassis fruit starts to move to the fore. It may still be a bit of a gamble, but it should round into form by 2012 and drink well through 2017.",29.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Offers a flavor of the Rhône at a reasonable price, featuring black cherry and plum aromas that show just a hint of raisining. The flavors head toward date and chocolaty richness, buffered by soft tannins. Drink now.",15.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A severe wine, its structure deriving from an important wood element and fruit tannins. It brings out apple and green plum skins, with a tangy texture that demands a few months aging.",56.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is a soft, creamed apple wine, with touches of toast. It has a great lemon zest character that brings freshness as well as brilliant acidity. The finish is textured, very fresh.",65.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Full in the mouth, this is a rich, wood-lifted wine, the peach and apricot fruits given an edge by a light steeliness. The acidity fits well into the rich flavors here, creating a burst of apple juice over the yellow fruits. Imported by Louis Latour Inc.",15.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Yes, there is a slight layer of tannin. But for a Nuits-Saint-Georges, this is surprisingly soft and juicy, showing fresh cherry and raspberry flavors. It's certainly enjoyable, but not for aging.",55.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This is a blend made from purchased grapes at Château Sainte-Roseline, giving a soft, vanilla-tinted wine, maybe just on the fat side.",11.00,Provence,Rosé
"A creamy style of Sauvignon Blanc, showing soft pear juice and flora flavors, fresh with a feeling of richness. Screwcap.",10.00,Southwest_France,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Beautifully perfumed in a relatively light style, this Santenay is full of red fruits, sweet tannins and mouthwatering acidity. It has some richness, although the main character is of freshness.",60.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A wine with good bottle age along with yeasty acidity and a fine citrus character. It is a light style, with just a hint of toast. The acidity is delicious.",55.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This wine's smooth texture is soft, velvety, needing tannins to give it a sense of shape. As it tastes in the mouth now, it shows pleasant sweet berry flavors and a dense mouthfeel. In the end, it is an easy-drinking, early maturing wine.",12.00,Bordeaux,Merlot
"Still fresh, this shows red currant and red berry fruit flavors over a smoky layer of wood, licorice and spice. It has some warmth, a smoothly textured wine that only has a glimpse of rustic tannin beneath the flavors.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Showing new wood, this is a straight down the line red Bordeaux. The tannins are firm, maybe the wood gives a burnt character but the fruit comes through strongly, giving fresh, sweet blackberry juice flavors. A good, dry, but lively finish.",10.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Big, powerful wine, full of both tannins and fruit. Being a 2008, the structure is firm and up-front, with the fruit and acidity lying behind. It will need to age for 2–3 years and more to come into balance.",58.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Peach and lemon combine in this superripe Chablis. Reflecting the warm vintage, the wine is soft, laced with lime juice acidity and hinting at vanilla and thyme. Round and warm, it is not typical Chablis, much more akin to a Meursault.",42.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"The Roux family, based in Saint-Aubin, is a specialist in wines from the villages in the hills above the Côte de Beaune. This full-bodied wine is still closed, wood and peach flavors still emerging. Keep it for 1–2 years to reveal the richness.",26.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Notes of sweet oak spice infuse the chunky dark fruit notes of black berry, plum and cherry. The smooth mouth shows clean and lifting acidity partnered with approachable tannins, transitioning into a finish loaded with spicy flavors of black pepper and whole nutmeg.",35.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend

"Quite a firm wine, the tannins giving smoky bacon flavors over some tight dryness. The fruit is there—juicy red currant fruit, topped by bright, fresh acidity.",23.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Pale in color, this wine goes for shades of flavor. The initial tannins merge into softer raspberry flavors that in turn become fresh red currants and final acidity. Ready to drink now.",25.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir

"Ripe red cherry fruit, laced with refreshing acidity, gives this wine a great lift and liveliness. Its fruit goes right through the palate, with soft tannins as a backdrop. Drink this year.",14.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"A finely crisp wine, with a soft character, very fresh. There are great lemon and pink grapefruit flavors on the finish.",60.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"While it is on the soft side, with sweetness, this Champagne also has an attractive lemon freshness to go with the vivid mousse. It's a fine apéritif style of Champagne.",50.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A very soft style of wine, perhaps lacking distinctive character, but offering attractive ripe red fruits. There is some minerality, and the acidity is obvious, especially in the aftertaste. It is missing flesh and weight and should be drunk now.",40.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"With no oak aging, there's a great freshness to the gutsy black fruit core of this wine as well as an intense garrigue herbaceousness and mineral streak expressed throughout the nose and mouth. Medium weight with approachable tannins and a lively, clean finish. Drink now.",20.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Rich Muscadet, with lemon, green herb and pear flavors, rounded with some tangy weight. There is some density as well as intense acidity. Drink this winter.",12.00,Loire_Valley,Melon

"Raspberry Pinot Noir fruit is on fresh display. The wine is light, with the tight acidity of the vintage, but the varietal purity sings out.",39.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Crisp and fresh, a well-balanced wine that shows vivid fruit, acidity as well as weight. The crispness at the end gives a delicious final burst.",16.00,Provence,Rosé
"Already mature, this is a light, mushroom and spice flavored wine. The fruit is now a part of the secondary flavors, a nutmeg sweetness giving some interest. To be drunk now.",35.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Full-bodied, rich-feeling wine, quite sumptuous in its texture. It has a layer of tannins to give structure, although the wine is essentially soft and enveloping.",18.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"Young and yeasty wine, with the freshest raspberry flavor. It is a light style, floating with the fruit and acidity, the finish on the softer side.",85.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Rich, full bodied and medium dry, it is powered by ripe fruits, lychees and pomegranates. A spicy undertow brings along some acidity to this concentrated wine. Drink from 2016.",34.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"A well-balanced off-dry Vouvray. It has almond as well as ripe pear and apple flavors, laced with the acidity of 2010, although never losing its delicate sweetness. This should age for 3–4 years. Screwcap.",16.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"This wine needs some time to open up in the glass, but once it finally does you'll be greeted with an attractive bouquet loaded with savory herbs, leather, dark chocolate, espresso grinds and black cherry and berry fruit aromas. Dusty tannins and medium acidity frame the solid structure and linger through the long finish. Drink now-2014.",20.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Well structured, strongly laced with wood, this is a full-in-the-mouth red, very berry and cherry. Its ripe fruit opens gently to give a concentrated finish. Age for another year, but very drinkable now.",33.00,Loire_Valley,Pinot_Noir
"The off-dry version of Vaugondy's Vouvray brings out ripe apple as well as pineapple and lemon flavors. It is still crisp, packed with acidity, rounded out with finishing sweetness.",15.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Structured, tight wine, with obvious wood character. It has an apple skin texture, giving it a steely edge. On the other side, the wine has pear and sweet apricot fruits add some richness to this ready-to-drink wine.",50.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Fresh strawberry and caramel aromas start the wine well, but the palate has a bitter edge of almonds, lifed by some juicy acidity and a light apple skin aftertaste.",15.00,Provence,Rosé
"Aromatic wine that shows fresh red berry fruits and a light texture. This is perfect apéritif material, its fruit bright and forward.",15.00,Provence,Rosé
"A tight, firmly tannic wine. It does show pleasing berry fruits, and it has freshness, but the acidity is very apparent, and courses through the fruit and tannins. The finish is tart black currant. Screwcap.",10.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Wonderfully aromatic wine that brings forward red cherry fruit over the more solid tannins and dry core. It is open, packed with fruit and acidity, obviously ready to drink, although likely to age.",65.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Yeasty wine, with strawberry acidity and an edge of bitterness. The wine is light, frothy in the mouth, the fruit tight with a red currant finish.",95.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Owned by Guigal but made at a separate facility, Vidal-Fleury's 2005 Crozes-Hermitage offers plummy aromas of superripe fruit, but lacks any midpalate richness. It's a crisp, medium-bodied Syrah with a supple, easy-to-like finish.",18.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Mega-négociant Guigal has turned out a fine Crozes-Hermitage in 2004, one that accurately reflects the strengths and weaknesses of the vintage. There's admirable purity of cherry, peppery fruit but also a certain lack of concentration. The result is a pretty wine that should be consumed over the near term. Imported by Ex Cellars Wine Agencies, Inc.",18.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"This has 20% new wood, adding vanilla flavors to the fruity red berry flavors. The tannins wrap easily around the fruit, giving a tight core, but then fresh acidity and bright strawberries linger on the finish.",28.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This is rounded, rich, missing some acidity but with the compensation of ripe yellow fruits layered with pineapple and spice from wood. With all its sweetness, it is not for aging.",31.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"The bouquet of this wine is quite forward and floral, with strong scents of carnation, violet and lavender. The fruit appears secondary to the herbal backbone, with a touch of blueberry and cocoa making an appearance on the mouthwatering close. Drink now.",19.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Rounded, soft wine, its acidity an adjunct to the ripe white peach and fig flavors. There is an attractive edge of fruit skin tannin, bringing out the acidity. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",22.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Ripe, spicy wine that already has a more mature flavor of almonds and green herbs to go with the acidity and juicy white currants. There is a final bite of fruit skin tightness to what is a rich wine. Imported by Palm Bay International.",34.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Soft, sweet fruit flavors of ripe pear and white peaches gives a warmth to this immediately attractive wine. It offers pure fruit, lightly freshened by acidity and slight minerality, but generally rich and easy. Imported by Louis Latour Inc.",19.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This soft, gentle, white fruit-flavored wine sums up the easy aspect of this famed appellation. The wood perfectly balances the light fruits and acidity. Imported by Louis Latour Inc.",29.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"The wine offers flavors that range from sweet plum skins to hedgerow black fruits, while at the same time giving soft tannins. This is attractive Pinot Noir, though not plumbing many depths. It finishes ripe and sweet.",38.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Somewhat hard edged, this is as dry as possible, hinting at toast as well as lentils and quince. The acidity is balanced, but the wine shies away from the pleasure factor.",18.00,Provence,Rosé
"The balance of this wine is what makes it so impressive. Spice and yellow fruit intermingle effortlessly. There is a core of tight, coiled steel, like a spring, which gives minerality along with the richness. At the end, acidity lifts the wine, finishing with freshness as well as intensity.",451.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Taut and mineral, this is currently a wine that is waiting to reveal its power and majesty. The fruit is on a tight rein of acidity, which only slowly opens up to show mango, pineapple, crisp citrus, layers of toast and a mouth-enveloping richness. Age for at least five years, preferably 10.",574.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"What makes a great Chablis grand cru? It's the intensity of flavor, which can be found in this wine. Its green and white fruits are layered with wood spice and an ineffable crispness that allows the wine to show the purity of Chardonnay and the great terroir at the same time.",90.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is a bright star in Olivier Leflaive's firmament, a wondrous big, rich wine that is just so finely poised. The structure is dense, rich, fat and full-bodied, a hymn to ripe fruit. Flavors are fruit-driven at this stage, but this is a wine that will develop over many years, if you can resist the urge to indulge its luxuriant tastes now.",310.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A beautiful wine, a pure expression of ripe but steely Chardonnay. The wine floats onto the palate, with green plums and citrus leading. Then come toast, a mouthwatering acidity and a mineral structure. This wine's complexity just continues to impress.",80.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is from a sub-division of the Corton vineyard, at the northern end of the Grand Cru. It shows both depth of flavor and freshness, a ripe wine that brings in delicious, appetizing acidity and spicy toast. It will obviously age, the nuts and secondary flavors still waiting to show, but as a fruitier style it will be ready in a year.",235.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A superb wine. It opens slowly in the mouth, revealing layers of toast followed by intense white and green fruits. Spice and nutmeg accent the kiwi, pepper and pineapple notes, all concentrated around a core of minerality. Age for at least four years.",152.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Big, powerful brush strokes of ripe fruits, spice and rich creaminess paint this wine with vividness. The fruit envelops the mouth, the pears, green plums and ripe apples working with a citrus edge. Impressive, and with a great finishing freshness.",80.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This monopole within the Chablis grand cru vineyards produces top Chablis. In 2006, the wine is powerful, but layered with intense minerality, a flinty character on top of the ripe white and yellow fruits. It has concentration, a depth of flavor that is impressive. It will age well.",90.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A beautiful, ripe wine that shows the richness of 2006 in Chablis. The wine revels in its yellow fruit flavors, apricots, peaches even pineapple, underscored by new wood flavors. Then acidity comes through, a fresh lift that leaves the wine with a clean, smooth finish. And once these initial fruits soften, the secondary flavors promise some good aging. Screwcap.",117.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Pale salmon pink, this is a beautiful wine both to look at and to taste. It combines a light touch of red fruits with bright acidity and a rich texture. Fresh and pure fruited, it will age through 2015.",52.00,Provence,Rosé
"With rich apricot juice, sweet red apples and a dry spiciness, it is complex and has aging potential. A mineral element in the texture emphasizes the dry yet rich nature of the wine. Drink from 2015.",62.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"This full-bodied wine pushes the concept of rosé to its limits. Wood-aged and rich, it conveys a sense of structure, mature fruit and delicious toastiness. It has already been aged an extra year, but would benefit from cellaring even longer, so wait until 2015.",100.00,Provence,Rosé
"The palest of grey-pink rosés, this is classy, fresh and fragrant. It has a light, orange-zest texture as well as tannins and a mineral edge. Very fresh, it is also worth aging a few months.",29.00,Provence,Rosé
"This is a rich, smooth, vanilla-flavored wine that is impressively ripe while keeping all its freshness. It has a sense of concentration, with ripe strawberry and red cherry fruits and enough structure to allow it to age. Drink from 2015.",23.00,Provence,Rosé
"It's hard to like this wine. That doesn't mean it is faulty, it means it seems cold, a very hard-edged style of Pinot Noir. It has the Nuits-St-Georges structure in bucketfuls. The acidity also makes its presence felt, giving a sharp burst on the finish.",55.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Fresh, simple, apple-flavored wine, with an edge of citrus and soft vanilla flavors. The wine is attractive and clean with elegance coupled to ripe fruit.",13.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Made from Château de Fuissé's young vines, this is light, fresh, mineral wine, lightly spiced, with attractive citrus juiciness. Drink now. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",24.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Big, full, juicy wine with red cherry and plum flavors. There is a fine edge of tannins to give the wine tautness and structure. Drink now. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd.",23.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This is a clean, crisp, soft wine that just speaks of Chardonnay. There is freshness here, just a touch of creamy vanilla, but the rest is light, finishing with a lift of acidity. Imported by Cellar Door Selections.",21.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Port Grimaud is a fishing village at the head of the Gulf of Saint-Tropez. This wine from the local cooperative is soft, on the bland side, but very attractive for the price.",10.00,Provence,Rosé
"A light, fresh style, bringing out grapefruit flavors, herbaceous and crisp. The wine is pure green fruits, bright and bursting with thirst-quenching acidity.",7.00,Southwest_France,White_Blend
"This is powerful, typical of Les Preuses. White and yellow fruits are important to the palate, but so are rich, honeyed toast, minerality and an opulent, intense concentration. This is impressive, elegance with power, and worth aging for several years.",67.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Sumptuous and rich, a fully gorgeous Chardonnay, with butter and citrus flavors combining with panache. The wine just fill the mouth, a succession of pineapple, soft toast, spice and mango flavors, finished with acidity. To drink now, but it is worth keeping for 2–3 years.",99.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"The high toast aromas, typical of Chanson wines, can be off-putting. But get beyond the wood, which needs a couple more years to integrate, and the ripe fruit of 2005 gives this wine density and character. The yellow fruits, ripe cantaloupe melon flavor and sweet acidity will more than hold their own against the wood.",235.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A rich, mouthfilling,  sophisticated wine. The secret is in the balance, with the concentrated fruit flavors—dried apricot, mango and lemon—in just the right proportion. It tastes delicious now, but will certainly age over five years or more.",273.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"The Château Grenouilles vineyard, wholly owned by members of the La Chablisienne cooperative, is in the upper part of Grenouilles Grand Cru. As such, this is major Chablis, a wine that needs maybe 10 years' aging. But already, you can discern the richness of this wine, its powerful yellow fruits, honey and toast, dense in texture as well as vivid with acidity.",99.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is a rare venture by Olivier Leflaive outside his home territory around Puligny, Chassagne and Meursault. The wine is classic Corton-Charlemagne, big and bold, a broad-shouldered wine that brings together toastiness, ripe pineapple and mango and balancing, lively acidity. It is already giving great pleasure, but should last well over the next decade.",150.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This steely, mineral, structured wine speaks of the chalk soil of Puligny. It is firm and crisp, even though the fruit is rich. The wine layers the white fruits and mandarin orange zest with some judicious toast from the wood, leaving spice and ripe acidity on the finish.",115.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"There is a definite richness to this wine, the ripe white fruit and melon flavors aided by a judicious amount of vanilla and toast. That makes the wine seductive, but Laroche does not forget its Chablis origins and leaves enough room for a core of grapefruit, steel and tight acidity. Screwcap.",145.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Showing the typical power of Corton-Charlemagne, this is a classic wine that offers full-on fruit allied to a strong wood element. It is rich and bold, flavored with white fruits, apricots, almonds and spice. While it is drinkable now, it would certainly repay cellaring for 3–4 years.",130.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is one of Olivier Leflaive's benchmark wines, showing how his winemaker Franck Grux keeps lightness, freshness and complexity all in play. To start, it is firm and austere, then it bursts out with green fruits, toast, white currants and lemon, integrated and balanced. Drink now, or age for 2–3 years.",90.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"While Les Clos is less well known than some other grands crus, it does give an impressively complete wine. Initially rounded, it then shows some many other facets. All the elements are here, the proper steely core, the rich white and yellow fruits, and the shaft of acidity that cuts through the wood and the richness.",70.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This wine from a parcel in the Fourchaume vineyard is a step up from the Fourchaume premier cru wine. That's because it has an extra edge of minerality, of apple skins and tight, ageworthy green fruits. With its final burst of acidity, this will certainly mature over the next 3–4 years.",55.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Soft toast, almond skin, wood-grilled peaches and honeydew aromas carry through to the rich mouth. Creamy and full with balanced acidity and a cedary finish. A blend of 85% Roussanne, 10% Grenache Blanc and 5% Viognier.",24.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"This rosé needs to age. It has a zesty, crisp and mineral texture that is tight and nervy. As it softens, more red fruits will come to the front, although the structure will remain, making this a serious rosé for drinking with food.",29.00,Provence,Rosé
The palest of rosés is also a serious wine. It has a firm and mineral character that goes along with ripe red fruits and a tight texture. It needs to age for a few months and is really meant to go with food.,45.00,Provence,Rosé
"After an extra year's aging, this wine's richness is very apparent. It may have lost immediate freshness but it has gained in ripe fruits, in texture and in depth. It's a complex wine worth pairing with food.",23.00,Provence,Rosé
Red cherries and jelly fruits highlight a wine that is ripe and soft. A hint of acidity puts the sweetness into attractive relief.,25.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A fresh, very strawberry and plum skin flavored Pinot Noir from Irancy, a small area near Auxerre and close to Chablis. The wine has some weight because of the vintage, which gives ripeness and an edge of rusticity. It's certainly more than just a curiosity.",20.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A wine that seems to take the softness of Chambolle-Musigny too far. It has sweetness and flavors of raspberry juice, leaving no room for structure or acidity. Drink now, because this wine is too open to last.",75.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Warm and rounded wine, with almond flavor and the ripe red fruits to go with the intense and balancing acidity. The wine is rich, while also well textured, giving fine final acidity.",22.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"There's a wild, natural streak to this wine of garrigue herbs and game matched with fruit notes of dark cherry and plum guts. The medium-weight mouth is juicy but offers nice structre with dusty tannins and a fudgy finish. Drink now.",15.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Soft and rounded, this is an open style of Chardonnay from one of the great white wine values in the Côte d'Or of Burgundy. The wine has richness, wood layers, flavors of peach, herbs and vanilla. It is attractively ready to drink now.",26.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Orange-tinted rosé, a rounded, soft and peach-flavored wine. It has fine freshness, soft acidity and a ripe aftertaste. An attractive apéritif style.",48.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Attractively colored wine with red berry fruits and an edge of bitter cherries, almonds and perfumed acidity. The wine is structured, spicy, full-bodied in character.",21.00,Provence,Rosé
"Assertive aromas of rosemary, thyme and laurel dominate the bouquet of this medium-weight wine. Flavors of high-toned black cherry and boysenberry keep the mouth fresh and the finish mouthwatering.",17.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A soft, open style of wine. Fresh, ripe strawberry flavors give sweetness, without much balancing tannin. The finish is soft, sweet, like children's pink candy.",33.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"The juicy acidity is the dominant character of this wine, with its very fresh red plum and raspberry flavors. It is pure fruit, tightened by small tannins, but keeping that acidity always at the front. Imported by Robert Kacher Imports.",24.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Piercingly fresh Pinot Noir, with red berry flavors and vibrant acidity. The grapes were probably only just ripe, and there is a hint of green here, but Ambroise has made a deliciously crisp red wine, soft, ready to drink. Screwcap. Imported by Robert Kacher Imports.",52.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A soft, easy citrus- and pear-flavored wine, just fruit and caramel. This is almost apéritif Chardonnay, fresh and finishing crisply. From the village of Chardonnay in the Mâcon region. Imported by Louis Latour Inc.",17.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"There is an attractive spring in the step of this wine, all bright citrus and fresh, crisp acidity. Softer melon flavors and creamy apples round it out. Imported by Palm Bay International.",22.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A creamy, soft wine, light and fresh, floating citrus, green plums and white berries. Don't age, drink now. Screwcap. Imported by Boisset America.",17.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Highly perfumed aromas announce this wine. It first tastes of candy shop, and then adds in acidity, fresh apples and some rich white fruits. Screwcap.",10.00,Southwest_France,White_Blend
"A spicy wine, with green tannins, a tight texture and a tart, stalky character. The wine seems too lean.",22.00,Provence,Red_Blend
"An impressive wine, with its tense structure, its ripe pear and melon flavors and its layers of richness. The smooth wood shows slowly and gently as it underlies the fruit flavors. There is also power here, and a definite ability to age.",78.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"It seems at first taste very rounded, very soft. It is only after a moment that the full balance between acidity, green plums and rounded vanilla comes together. Then the wine shows itself as powerful, but taut, full but crisp, as a Chablis should be.",78.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A beautifully shaped wine that exudes richness balanced with lively fresh fruits. There is a tautness and minerality that adds complexity to the pineapple and spice flavors. The wine opens well in the mouth, ripeness and full fruit flavors melding easily. Delicious.",101.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Still young, this is a wine that needs to open and ripen. But already there are signs of richness, a wood- and tropical fruit-flavored wine that is typical of the full character of a Corton Charlemagne. It would be worth keeping 2–3 years for the wood to soften, the fruit to round out.",189.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Round, soft, with the fruit dominating its mineral character, this wine shows richness, but doesn't have huge aging ability. It is more a wine that charms, is open, lively, spice and dried apricots working together with ripe acidity.",67.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A wine that is pure green and steel, only just hinting at wood. It has a very direct taste profile of taut green fruits, layers of acidity, just spiced up with toast and vanilla. It's obviously young, and should definitely be aged for 2–3 years.",45.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Powerful wine that goes for the big, opulent style. Yet it has the serious intent and structure of a great wine, its minerality intense, the tropical fruits balanced with concentrated acidity. This is a wine that needs at least five years' aging.",70.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Perfumed white flower aromas lead into a wine that is dense and ripe. As the palate opens up, white and yellow fruits, cinnamon and buttered toast all work their ways into a wine that is almost a meal in itself. Still young, of course, already fresh, it will surely deepen and broaden as it ages. Screwcap.",87.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A medium sweet wine, it is full of ripe tropical fruits. It has a rounded texture, generous and opulent in feel with an intense, concentrated structure. Spicy and warm, it needs several years to rdevelop. Drink from 2016.",34.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"One of the two luxury wines from Château d'Esclans, Les Clans is rich, wood-aged and full of ripe and rounded fruit flavors. With the extra year of aging, it has lost some initial freshness but has gained complexity and structure. The wine is full-bodied while remaining very stylish. Drink now.",70.00,Provence,Rosé
"The La Londe appellation came into existence in 2008 and this wine celebrates that fact. Rounded and smooth, it has a touch of saltiness as well as dried red berry fruits and intense acidity. Drink from the end of 2014.",29.00,Provence,Rosé
"Packed with red fruits, it shows structure and concentration. A mineral texture brings out the freshness of the fruit while also giving complexity. It could benefit from aging, so wait until the end of 2014.",23.00,Provence,Rosé
"Starts off with some promising aromas of licorice and plum, but seems a touch overripe, as the fruit turns pruny and chocolaty on the palate. Despite that, it remains balanced by crisp acids and isn't overly heavy, instead offering a somewhat generic red wine experience.",19.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Fairly deep in color for a sparkling rosé, Sparr's Brut Rosé offers bold, berry-like aromas with hints of spring flowers and a plump, slightly corpulent feel in the mouth. The flavors are a bit rustic, with hints of underbrush and scorched earth.",20.00,Alsace,Sparkling_Blend
"With its palest of red colors, this is real cool-climate Pinot Noir. The palate is lean, just hinting at some strawberry flavors, but with high acid and tight, smoky tannins.",15.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Ladoix is a forgotten Burgundy village that can offer good value. This wine with its strawberry fruits and gentle tannins fits the bill. There is a fine, ripe feel to it, and a dry edge that sets off the fruitiness.",32.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Lean cherry, strawberry and red plum aromas start off the nose of this wine, and gradually subside to reveal a stony, flinty streak augmented with soft garrigue herbs. Soft spice and ripe fruit continue in the medium-weight mouth, the fine grain tannins coating your palate and staying through the slightly chewy and fudgy close. Mature now, so drink up.",12.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend

"There's no mistaking the variety. This wine says juicy, jammy strawberry-flavored Pinot Noir. It's relatively light in texture, soft, with a burst of acidity, a wine that hides nothing. Imported by Louis Latour Inc.",17.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Some bright black currant flavors are found on a wine that feels light and fresh, with some spice and a high acid content.",20.00,Provence,Red_Blend
"Very green aromas and a palate that is crisply green-fruited make a great contrast with the more intense Côte Bouguerots wine from the same grand cru. The palate has a very tight, taut character, on the end of an elastic band, with a green, crisp finish. Give this at least three years' aging.",75.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"An initially wood-laden wine that only slowly reveals the rich fruit character. There is wood certainly, but the spice integrates well with the green fruits and the intense minerality. The great steely backbone on this wine indicates it will age.",78.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A very sensuous wine, showing its ripe fruit paces, its richness, just with a hint of wood, and its dense texture. The wine has spice, green plums, a citrus twist. It also has depth of flavor. Worth aging, but drinkable now.",78.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is rich, full-bodied Chardonnay, rounded out with peaches and spiced apricots. The wood is evident here, giving an extra softness as well as bringing out rich honey. A wine that opens beautifully in the mouth, ready to drink but also ageworthy.",35.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A premier cru that could almost be grand cru in quality terms, this is a big, ripe wine, the powerful yellow and green plum flavors spiced with some wood aging. There's a great, full-bodied explosion of fruit in the mouth, but the mineral edge of the wine suggests aging potential, perhaps even more  ageable than the 2005 vintage.",35.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Made from 70-year-old vines planted by Christian Moreau's father, Guy, this wine shows extra concentration, certainly, but also the pure pleasure of ripe, delicious Chardonnay. It's initially tight, but the rich green fruits and toast soon come forward to give an impressively big wine, and one worth aging.",48.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A blend of 80% Viognier and 20% Roussanne that spent nine months in French oak, this is a rich and developed wine with intense characteristics of peaches and cream, buttered popcorn, guava and honeydew. Round and dense with a spicy finish.",70.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_White_Blend

"The wine feels rich, dense and packed with ripe fruitiness. Delicious, refreshing acidity gives these red fruits a lift and crispness. This is a serious wine, demanding food.",25.00,Provence,Rosé
"This benchmark rosé is round yet fresh, and crisp while ripely fruity. Red berry fruits are finely textured and attractive acidity cuts through the full body of the wine. It would be worth aging until late 2014.",21.00,Provence,Rosé
"With its strawberry flavor and tight acidity, this is an attractive, clean sparkling wine. It has just the right balance between acidity and bright fruit, leaving a textured aftertaste.",20.00,Burgundy,Sparkling_Blend
"A superrich wine, full of apricot and Golden Delicious apples, with a touch of wood that rounds out the chalky, mineral texture. The wine is a delicious balance between ripe fruit and structure, ready to drink.",20.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
There is some weight on this young tasting wine. The tannins are beginning to allow the red berry and damson fruits to open up. Touches of wood round it out for aging.,24.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Light, fresh wine, showing pineapple and pear flavors, but in a delicate way. It has lift, crispness, a fine touch of citrus and a hint of toast. An attractive, easy white Burgundy. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",17.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A fresh, high-acid wine, with flavors of raspberry and apple. It's crisp, with fruit that is barely ripe. Needs plenty of chilling.",14.00,Provence,Rosé
"The estate wine from Sacha Lichine's Château d'Esclans discloses deeper color than some rosés from Provence. It has a ripe feel, smooth red fruits and a touch of toastiness. Full-bodied and dry, it is definitely a food rosé, and best left until late 2014 before drinking.",35.00,Provence,Rosé
"This ripe wine has jammy red fruit flavors. The fruitiness is given structure by the stalky tannins and the dry, wood-aging flavors. Black cherries and juicy black currants show strongly. It needs to age, so drink from 2016.",20.00,Provence,Red_Blend
"A tight, vivid wine that expresses pure Chardonnay with a steely eye. The wine is flinty, the green fruits and apple skin texture dominant. There is some wood, but the lightest touch. The finish shows some crisp, lemony acidity.",78.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Ripe and soft, here is a Chanson white that hasn't been overwhelmed by wood. Instead, the delicious yellow and white stone fruits come through, with a creamy edge reminiscent of buttered English muffins, finishing on a high note of juicy, thirst-quenching acidity.",115.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"New wood and yellow fruit aromas give an exotic spice- and caramel-flavored wine. The acidity is rounded, sweet, delicious, lifted by intense new wood flavors. This is a rich Chardonnay, well tempered by final crispness.",37.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is one of the most popular Chablis premier crus, and this soft wine shows why. It hints at minerality, but the main flavors are a great burst of apple and citrus. It has just the right vivid green character, the vanilla from the wood a very subtle afterthought.",55.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Very mineral wine, with considerable acidity, apple and grapefruit flavors. Flavors from wood give an extra character to this wine, which is ready to drink.",50.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay

"While there is definitely some intensity of bitter cherry fruit, there is also a stalky edge to this wine that comes from tart, dry tannins. The finishing acidity gives some freshness, but this remains on the edge of green. Screwcap. Imported by Robert Kacher Imports.",27.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Grand Ordinaire is the most basic of Burgundy's appellations, from outlying vineyards. Within that parameter, Bertrand Ambroise produces a light, fresh, citrus- and fresh pineapple-flavored wine, ready-to-drink with a touch of green apple skins to give structure. Screwcap. Imported by Robert Kacher Imports.",23.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay

"The fruit here is attractive, pears and white currants on top of pink grapefruit and orange zest. It shows its structure and its tense minerality only slowly, allowing the acidity to give it a lift and vibrancy. This is a wine that is still young, still smoothing out its hard edges.",47.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay

"This is the top cuvée from Sainte-Roseline (you can tell from the weight of the bottle). It has power, a smooth texture and a rounded aftertaste. The red fruits are well integrated into the rich texture. It would be worth aging this until the end of 2014.",60.00,Provence,Rosé

"Heavily wooded, this is a wine in which the toastiness is too much for the fruit. You can feel the weight, with hints of white fruits, but all that wood is just too much. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd.",22.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Very light, flavored with fruit drops and pear juice, this feels soft, verging on dilute. Yes, there are some easy fruity flavors, but the acidity is missing and the wine is unstructured. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd.",20.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"While there is plenty of berry fruit and spice here, there is an awkward petrol character that also shows itself in the shoe polish aromas. If this can blow off, then this is a wine with potential richness. Since it is only just bottled, time will tell. But be cautious. Two bottles tasted. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",53.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir

But it is more than the sum of its parts, an elegant, steely, poised wine that finishes crisp and tight.",60.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Big, ripe, generous, this wine is on the rich side of the 2006 vintage. At this stage, it offers peach and apricot, with honeyed yeast flavors. The minerality crispens the texture, while black pepper and firm tannins suggest aging ability.",67.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A rounded, creamy style of wine but with a deliciously fresh green fruit and citrus character. It shows very pure, direct flavors, a line that goes right through the wine. There is only a hint of spice or toast at the mouthwateringly fresh finish.",78.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay

"With its distinctive bouquet of rose petals and lychee fruit, this dessert wine's Gewürztraminer character shines clearly through a modest veil of botrytis. It's sweet and viscous without being overly heavy, with a long, spice-driven finish. Tremendous stuff, with a wonderful sense of harmony and balance.",90.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"With a distinct smoothness from wood, this is soft and ripe. It shows delicious toast, pear and melon flavors, lightened with some final acidity. Screwcap.",24.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Very ripe wine that tastes of the heat and sunshine of the vintage. It is warm, the peach and pineapple flavors partnering the toast and spicy vanilla. The wine has some power, maybe missing out on acidity.",20.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A blend of 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah, this wine spent 12 months in French oak and it shows with asserive characteristics of sweet spice, chocolate and hickory-smoked bacon among the plum and boysenberry fruit flavors. Light tannins and an easygoing structure; drink now.",20.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend

"Flavors of high toast wood are very dominant in this wine, and mingle with green herb, ripe pineapple and spice.

It could well age, and will certainly integrate more in the next two years.",60.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A wine that brings out soft richness, with a creamy apple texture layered with green plum skin tannins. The wine has some tautness as well, giving a tight structure that opens up. There's a great mineral, steely streak, with freshness showing through on the finish.",56.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"The relatively unknown Côte de Léchet vineyard is on the southern bank of the Serein river, which gives it a cool exposure. The result in 2006 is a wine that is light, delicate, floating on fresh green fruits and honeyed toast. It needs food, with its crisp, fine finish.",30.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A ripe, full wine, immediately accessible, speaking both of minerality and fresh acidity. The fruit goes right to the green apples, kiwi and juicy lemon flavors, but the structure is bold and rounds out these crisp fruits. A wine for aging, perhaps 2–3 years.",35.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Very soft, rounded wine, with yellow fruits, peaches and apricots vying with spice from wood for supremacy. At the heart, there is some steely character, but this is a big-hearted, full-on wine.",34.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay

"Aromas of licorice, crushed violets and menthol add depth to the otherwise straightforward black cherry and berry fruit notes. Medium weight with a solid structure and a finish kissed with sweet spice flavors. Drink now.",14.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"From old vines, a soft and creamy wine, with a toast and citrus edge. There is some concentration here, the acidity bringing out spice and final ripeness.",23.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay

"Textured wine, the crisp white fruits are tight against acidity and spice. It fills the mouth, broadening into a wine that becomes creamy, with wood and green plum skins giving structure. This is another example of how a lesser appellation can shine at the hands of a master vigneron.",52.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Open and soft, with rich, attractive flavors of caramel, milk custard and peaches. There is ripeness in abundance, followed by great intensity of flavor. Subtle wood underlies the wine.",38.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay

"Part of the range of negociant wines under the worldwide Xavier Flouret range, this Chablis is earthy, rustic, a soft but underwhelming wine, missing the proper bite of the region's wines. Imported by Cognac One, LLC.",23.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is a delicious, soft, tropical fruit-flavored wine. The texture is ripe, full, the mango fruits melting in the mouth, just touched by spice. If it misses the more mineral character of Chablis, the pleasure is sufficient compensation. Screwcap.",42.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Ripe tropical fruits, peach and pear flavors mingle well in this rich, toasty wine. To balance, there is citrus freshness, but the ripe flavors dominate. An immediately delicious wine that could be drunk now.",36.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A crisp, very textured wine that has red fruits and a salty edge from the closeness of the vines to the sea. It has a mineral texture, grapefruit and raspberry flavors, intense and bone dry. The wine needs food to be at its best.",22.00,Provence,Rosé
"With really ripe fruit and juicy black flavors, this is a rounded, warm wine. It tastes of sun, although there is also something more seriously structured about it. Acidity gives freshness, while the tannic structure suggests further aging. Drink now, but better in 2015.",14.00,Provence,Red_Blend
"White strawberry, hibiscus petals and soft garrigue notes are framed against a creamy and full structure. A touch of spice shines through on the finish, but overall the wine is lively and refreshing.",16.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé

"A ripe and rounded wine, with friendly apricot and lemon flavors, richly toasty, leaving great acidity and bright fruits at the end.",17.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay

"This firmly tannic wine has all the structure of 2010 without the fruit. It's a skeleton without flesh, and it will be unlikely to soften in the coming years.",25.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"An obviously wood-aged wine, this shows a bitter toast character. The fruit is lean, struggling to show through the dark chocolate flavor. It has an austere finish, which is mitigated by its final acidity.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This has juicy cherry and banana flavors, plus smoky tannins that give this wine a structure that's unusual for Beaujolais Nouveau. The acidity is just right, lending the finish freshness.",9.00,Beaujolais,Gamay

"Dominated by wood, spice and almonds, this is a structured wine that moves in a straight line from its white fruits to ageworthy acidity and toast. It is still young, a wine that needs time to mellow, to move away from its tense fruit.",47.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A complex name for this finely crafted wine. It shows green fruits and oak, some intensity of flavor and a great layer of acidity, cutting through the rich fruits. The finish brings all this acidity forward, giving a classic Chablis minerality.",108.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Obviously a wine to drink on February 14, this is brightly fruity and crisp while showing some good dense flavors. Red fruits push through the citrus and grapefruit acidity to give a full-bodied, ripe wine.",25.00,Provence,Rosé
"From a 100-acre estate formerly the home of the Counts of Provence, this wine has a great fruity character allied to a more mineral texture. With richness and vanilla flavors it is both packed with raspberry fruits and showing structure. Keep until the end of 2014.",20.00,Provence,Rosé
"Here's a rich and decadent Pinot with loads of muddled red berry notes mixed with assertive vanilla and sweet cigar tobacco spice. Juicy red cherry flavors flood the palate, while the finish is lifted by fresh garrigue herbs.",16.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Pinot_Noir
"With its lighter bottle (to reduce the carbon footprint of transport), this is described as a “greener” Champagne. In terms of taste, it is attractively soft, with flavors of baked apple and a tangy orange zest texture.",55.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"With its rich fruit, this is an immediately attractive wine. It shows the ripeness of the year in Saumur, bringing together apricot and cantaloupe melon flavors, the acidity a necessary and balancing adjunct to the full-bodied texture. Drink now, or age for 2–3 years.",18.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc-Chardonnay

It is structured, with green plum skins and orange zest, which give the wine a lift, and crispness, leaving a light, floating aftertaste.",30.00,Burgundy,Champagne_Blend
"Yes, there are some tannins and a chunky texture. But this wine is more simple Pinot Noir than structured Nuits-St-Georges. Its acidity and sweet blackberry fruits offer an attractive combination of freshness and jamminess. Not for aging.",50.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir

"This is a light wine, and the fruit is dominated by acidity. It has a tart red-currant flavor, with a hint of banana.",12.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"It is not easy to describe one of the majestic wines of France. This 2007 is still a wine in the making. All the elements are there: the intensity of dry fruits, the richness of spice and white fruit jams, opulent and austere at the same time. It is an extraordinary wine, with freshness, sweetness, dryness and acidity all just about perfectly balanced. Give it at least seven years.",90.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"More off-dry than medium sweet, this is a fabulously concentrated wine. It has honey, spice, lemon and sweet pear flavors, which give it a bright, vivid character in its youth. Expect it to close up for 3–4 years, before emerging again as a wine with elegance, balance and complexity.",45.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"The aromas of dried fruits do not show the sweetness and unctuousness of this ripe, botrytized wine. It has sweet honey flavors, spice, orange peel and a pure streak of acidity. This wine can age well, but it could also be drunk this year. Screwcap.",68.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc

"An intriguingly perfumed wine that brings out highly spicy wood as well as ripe yellow fruits. This is light and ready to drink, and already enjoyable for its ripeness combined with a fresh, toasty finish.",52.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Beautifully rich for such a lowly appellation in the Burgundy hierarchy. It is soft, open, dense, with ripeness and balancing acidity as well as flavors of pineapple and citrus pointing up the richness, just touched by wood.",56.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay

"If any rosé can be serious, it's this. It has structure as well as fruit, a sense of purpose, ripe red fruits and tight acidity. It could even age, so wait to drink it until late in summer 2014.",15.00,Provence,Rosé
"Quat' Saisons, meaning four seasons, suggests that this wine isn't just for summer. It is certainly a food wine with its dry, full-bodied character and ripe caramel and red plum flavors. Lively and fresh at the end, it's ready to drink.",24.00,Provence,Rosé

"A dry Vouvray from the clay soils of the Haut-Lieu vineyard. This rich but crisp, full-bodied wine shows intense green apple flavors, with a chalk texture, and is beautifully balanced. Like all Huët's biodynamically farmed wines, this is likely to last for years.",35.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Chidaine, based across the Loire in Montlouis, has only recently begun making wine from Vouvray as well. Le Bouchet is an off-dry wine that balances a core of minerality and acidity against intense richness. Flavors of sweet plums, apricots and almonds ride beautifully into the soft finish.",21.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Baumard's signature wine, named after the butterfly shape of the vineyard, is pure, exotic Chenin Blanc, rich, but not losing sight of the essential minerality of Savennières, its stony element coming through in the tight texture. This should certainly age—drink now, or wait for five years. Screwcap.",32.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Rich, finely balanced, an intense botrytis wine, full of sweet spices, honey, baked apples and sugar. Add in a texture of ripe pear skins and the layer of vivid acidity, and this is a great sweet wine. It will age for 10 years at least, but it can be drunk now.",86.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc

"Very soft, this offers generous white fruits, with a rounded, open structure. It rolls around the mouth, opulent and full. This is very typical of Simmonet-Febvre's Vaillons, which goes for richness rather than structure.",30.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"At this stage of this smooth caramel- and vanilla-flavored wine, the wood element is prominent. Yet it has good weight, and you can sense the ripe, green fruits here. The structure is soft, round, just given crispness as the wine develops.",35.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay

"90-92 Barrel sample. A very smoky character, with an attractive lightness. The fruit is bright, even though there is richness. The tannins give a dark, dry aftertaste.",60.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The wood is too much for the fruit with this wine. At this stage in its development, there is a bitter, high toast character that dominates the white fruits. Underneath all this toast, there are hints of fresh apples and cream flavors. Give it at least a year.",80.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A finely structured wine that brings out soft acidity as well as pear and red apple flavors. There is a great layer of toast, some spice and a rich, yeasty character. The wine is elegant, delicate, well balanced.",47.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Intense green plum, topped with pineapple sweetness and acidity, give this wine fine density of flavor. The fruit dominates, the wood a hint in the background, just offering some extra spice. There is a lively, juicy green and white fruit freshness to the finish.",71.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay

"Totally fresh and fruity, the wine also shows a light touch of vanilla. It is deliciously packed with ripe fruits, as well as acidity and some structure. Drink now.",15.00,Provence,Rosé
"As always, this is an elegant Loire sparkler. The Chenin Blanc's acidity comes to the fore here, giving a great lift to the melon, almond and nutmeg flavors. There's a crisp apple skin texture to this wine that is certainly best with food.",20.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"With its softness and medium-dry character, this is a great food wine for pâtés or blue cheese. It is finely in balance, its acidity giving a lift to the tangerine, peach and dried fruit flavors. The aftertaste is perfectly clean, creamy, lifted by acidity.",30.00,Burgundy,Champagne_Blend
"This is definitely a wine in the new ripe Bordeaux style, with rich black fruits and spicy tannins. Impressively dense, dusty fruit tannins are alongside smooth, polished new wood flavors. The acidity and black currants are the reminder that this is still Bordeaux, not New World.",35.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The current Alphonse Mellot is the 19th to bear the name, always passed in the family from father to son. Made from 80-year-old vines, aged on the lees before bottling, the wine has a fine concentration, giving generosity, a hint of yeastiness, spice, pink grapefruit and even a final burst of opulence.",84.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc

The yellow fruits—peach and fresh pineapple—are ripe, full in the mouth, helped by some nutmeg spice and a touch of caramel. Worth aging for another year.",26.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Everything is so fascinating in this wine. Clos de la Bergerie is salty and sweet, as if sea salt had been gently sprinkled on the ripest of mangoes and sweet peaches. It is poised, like a dancer, while at the same time being full and powerful. Finally, the mineral, chalky character of pure Chenin Blanc comes through. Age this wine for at least five years.",60.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Green vegetable aromas mingle with fresh kiwi and lime and a touch of pepper and salt. The wine is going through the sort of closed-up phase common with Chenin Blanc, the fruits just a hint, the texture smooth. Give it another 3–4 years, and the fruits will come together with mature almond flavors.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"A soft, rich and ripe wine, showing some light wood character and delicious forward pears and yellow plums, plus a crisp line of acidity that gives the wine a vivid lift and extra freshness. There is some minerality, but that is much less dominant than the fruit. Screwcap.",44.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay

"Plenty of botrytis here, packing the wine with its characteristic sweet/dry flavor, wild flower honey tastes and ripe apple flavors. Not a hugely rich Sauternes, this is finely in balance, leaving freshness as well as sweetness on the finish.",24.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"A heavy, full-bodied rosé with ripe, intense fruit flavors marred by a touch of nail-polish remover on the nose. It's still a decent drink with burgers, but it could have been so much better.",15.00,Rhône_Valley,Grenache-Syrah
"A wine made by using the color from the grape skins rather than the more normal Champagne method of adding red wine to give color to rosé. It gives a deep pink color with a wine that is rich, complex, full of red cherry and raspberry flavors.",98.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend

"The impact of 50-year old vines is seen in the concentrated fruit, ripe and full,  in this wine.

"A steely-styled wine, initially showing some bitterness, but with ripe citrus as a balance to the apples and pink grapefruit. This is a taut, poised wine, edging to green, with a strong tension and a final burst of toast.",30.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"All the fat fruit of Meursault was at its best in 2005, and even Chanson's use of high toast wood for aging the whites cannot hide it. Pineapple and peach flavors go with sweet yellow plums, juicy red apple acidity, and an exotic ginger and nutmeg spice that add complexity.",70.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Full bodied and ripe, it has great fruitiness as well as a textured, steely character that provides both freshness and structure. A complex wine it has some aging potential, certainly until the end of 2014.",30.00,Provence,Rosé
"As pale in color as it comes, this is a delicate, delicious wine. Vanilla flavors vie with the freshest acidity and then ripe red plum fruits to give a wine that is both rounded and crisp.",40.00,Provence,Rosé
"Ripe and smooth, it has layers of red fruits, a touch of caramel and delicious acidity. It's full of flavor with depth as well as some richness.",15.00,Provence,Rosé

"Beautifully perfumed Champagne, creamy and mineral at the same time. It has the freshest green apple character to go with a delicious rich, full flavor, grapefruit juice and a tight texture.",75.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Impressive, but so young, this is a Pinot Noir-dominated vintage, the richness as yet a mere hint in the welter of acidity and fruit. Already, though, this is   shaping up to be a structured, tight wine, with great final balance.",57.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This rich botrytized wine is certainly sweet. But the intense dry botrytis character is much more evident, with an edge of bitter honey, crushed brown sugar and tight, taut acidity. Put all this down to youth, because this potentially delicious wine needs aging for at least another five years.",30.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc

"Well balanced, ripe and fresh, it reveals raspberry fruits, an attractive mineral texture and citrus acidity. The style, definitely dry, needs food.",15.00,Provence,Rosé
"Soft and lightly fruity, it has flavors of bitter almonds as well as red fruits. This gives the wine a firm character with some tannins and a mineral texture. Wait until late 2014 before drinking.",15.00,Provence,Rosé
"This big, ripe wine is now past its youth. That is bringing out the toast, yeast and walnut flavors. But the acidity is not far away, coming from the taut texture, and leaving a crisp fresh, raspberry-flavored aftertaste.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc-Chardonnay
"A rich wine that shows plenty of berry fruits, supported by some dry but dusty tannins. This is a wine that is going to develop with its firm powerhouse of ripe fruit that is emerging from a tight period in its development.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This is the second wine of Château Balestard, and there are suggestions of high extraction and very ripe fruit. It does have balance, however, the black fruits need time to calm down. The acidity is all here, offering freshness to this rich wine.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A blend that includes three ancient Champagne varieties—Arbanne, Petit Meslier and Blanc Vrai—along with Chardonnay. The mix gives a full, perfumed and rich wine, with intense acidity as well as the crispest apple flavor. It is without question a wine for food.",70.00,Champagne,White_Blend

"While demi-sec is the description, this almost as dry as some Brut Champagnes. Its flavors are of walnuts and pear juice along with a fine drive of acidity. This is food Champagne, looking for richer white fish or scallops as a pairing.",46.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend

"The name, referring to the flinty soil of the vineyard, says it all. It is a mineral wine that tastes of stony soil, flint and chalk.

"Supersweet, but never cloying, with acidity, pear skin tannins and delicate sweet brown sugar and honey flavors. It is a great example of how Loire Chenin manages to keep its balance and freshness while still offering long-aging botrytis character. Keep for at least 10 years.",75.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Puy means a hill, and the steep slopes of the Côte du Puy offer great exposure for the vines. The result is a densely structured, very muscular wine that shows richness as well as dark tannins. The aftertaste is sweet, streaked with acidity.",29.00,Beaujolais,Gamay

"A rich, creamy, sumptuous wine, with an impressive, decisive shaft of minerality and a stony, dense character. The name of the wine, referring to the granite and schist soil, is one of an extraordinary series reflecting different soil types made by Muscadet's top producer, Guy Bossard.",20.00,Loire_Valley,Melon
"Certainly intense, dominated by dry botrytis, with the syrup element here in texture rather than taste.

"From volcanic soil, this ripe, but tight style of Muscadet is one that needs aging. Even after two years, the acidity has not completely molded round the fresh grapefruit flavors. It's lively, very crisp, demanding food.",24.00,Loire_Valley,Melon
"A very structured wine with tannins and dense fruit. Very Pinot Noir-like in its richness, smoothness and plum flavors. Deliciously rich and velvety smooth.",30.00,Beaujolais,Gamay

"A lightly fresh-faced wine, with apple and grapefruit flavors balanced with a soft texture. It is easy, attractive, ready to drink.",60.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A floral wine, dominated by apple blossom and baked apple flavors. It may be dry, but it is deliciously soft, its fruits very forward at this stage, only just edged with a grapefruit acidity. A great moment to drink now, but it may well close down for the next few years.",14.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"An enticing, perfumed wine, with velvet tannins, blueberry fruit flavors and a dense core of dryness. The wine has freshness but it has weight, too, based on smoky wood flavors and a final sweet and sour juiciness.",20.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc

"Gamay often becomes more like Pinot Noir as it ages. That's true of this wine, which displays strawberry and spice flavors, as well as an element of minerality. The aftertaste has ripe blackberry jelly.",22.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"Aged in wood, this cuvée is powerful, ripe and intense. The jellied red fruits are all sweet and rich, touched by acidity but mainly with good depth of flavor and structure. It would even be worth aging this for another year.",25.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"A full bodied, rich Pinot Noir, from a small 4-acre parcel, packed with solid tannins, bright, bitter cherry flavors and a definite high toast wood element. This is Vacheron's top red cuvée, and it does need several years to soften, open out and lose its raw wood edge.",60.00,Loire_Valley,Pinot_Noir

"The Palmes d'Or rosé is always distinctive, not always for the good. However, this 2003 vintage shows well, with ripe cherry flavors, yeast and a soft, open texture. The acidity adds a crisp lemon zest aftertaste.",200.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"For a normally crisp style, this Savennières is soft, open, almost hinting at sweetness. It makes for a wine that is more accessible, certainly, giving delicious, nut and pear flavors edged with a dusty texture of red currants. Hard to say if this will age, it is certainly a pleasure to drink now. Screwcap.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc

"A rounded wine, very green and opulent. Like many of the Fouassier wines, this needs time to breathe, as it gradually begins to show its intense currant, star fruit and green herbal character. Then the steel core comes through with a great burst of final acidity.",23.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Silex is the French name for the flint over limestone soil that occurs in the Sancerre and Pouilly regions. There is a definite character of tight texture in this wine, very mineral while it also has ripe fruit. This is a new wine from Fournier, an impressive addition to the range.",40.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Straw gold in color, this is a fragrant, delicately aromatic wine. Made from organic fruit, it has pure white fruit and mineral flavors that are cut with intense youthful acidity. It needs to develop, so wait to drink until 2016.",25.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Albrecht's sparkling rosé is a consistent performer year after year, offering delicate melon and peach aromas, modest fruit flavors and hints of chalky minerality, all carried by a soft, creamy mouthfeel. It's easy to drink and easy to like.",24.00,Alsace,Pinot_Noir

"A great rich waft of wood and peach sets the scene for a powerful, concentrated wine, its flavors of spice, yellow fruits and roasted peanuts enhanced by a slice of toast, butter, the acidity cutting right through everything. If there is a fault, it is the suggestion of heat, which comes from the alcohol.",17.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"It's worth noting the sec (dry) note on the label, because this is bone-dry Chenin. It does, though, have enough richness to bring a fine balance, with crisp apples, a mineral and steel character, and a taut-as-a-string texture. Drink now, or age for 2–3 years.",18.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc

"Soft and fruity, it's bone dry, very crisp and totally fresh. Red currants dominate this wine that has intense acidity and light zesty aftertaste.",15.00,Provence,Rosé
"Old vines give extra concentration to this rich wine. With fruitiness, a tight texture and the need to age, it has structure and density. Drink from 2015.",20.00,Alsace,Riesling
"A fruity wine, it shows ripe red berries, red currants and refreshing acidity. So while the wine has weight, it is also totally fresh and crisp. It's a rosé for food, rich while balanced.",20.00,Provence,Rosé
"In Provence, heavy bottle seems to equal high alcohol. It's true here, with a wine that, while it has the right pale grey pink color, is almost too rich for its own good. It does have fruit and acidity but they are just a part of a powerful and ripe wine. Age it until the end of 2014 for best results.",35.00,Provence,Rosé
"While the wine is full bodied and rich, it is also deliciously fresh and with lively fruitiness. There is great acidity here, a bright layer of red currant fruits and wild strawberries, making it a good food rosé.",20.00,Provence,Rosé
"Although the wine has some richness and yellow fruits, the crisp acidity and lemon zest dominate. Fragrant and very fruity, it has some extra structure to allow it to age. Drink from the end of 2014.",23.00,Provence,Provence_white_blend
"The unpredictable character of Pinot Noir makes it hard to pull off a Blanc de Noirs. And this wine doesn't entirely succeed. Yes, the wine is in balance, red fruits working with acidity. But there is hardness in the finish, a cranberry juice tartness, which spoils the rest of the party.",25.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Round and soft, this has fresh, attractive fruit, flavors of white pears, candy and green herbs. Just a touch of sweetness in the acidity of the aftertaste.",9.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Boasts layers of wood, with black currant and rich white fig flavors, along with dried fruits. This is a ripe, opulent wine reflecting the heat of 2003 in Bordeaux, but still retaining dry tannins that promise aging.",25.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Named in reference to the fact that his father kicked him out of the house at 12 years of age, this superripe cuvée of 46% Carignan, 30% Syrah, 19% Grenache and 5% Mourvèdre seems almost slightly nutty at first, then shows prune and chocolate notes that persist through the extended finish. It's a bit alcoholic, but richly textured and velvety. Imported by Bernard Magrez.",50.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Red_Blend
"Lightly sparkling, just off-dry wine, deliciously appley and fresh. There is a lovely edge of crisp, crunchy fruit along with a gentle acidity. Low in alcohol, this is a great apéritif, made by the single fermentation Gaillac method.",12.00,Southwest_France,Mauzac
"The Mailly cooperative's standard nonvintage is a well-balanced wine, emphasizing a dry style, while having enough richness to fill the mouth with ripe apple and pear flavors. A success and a great Champagne value.",46.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A soft wine that is full of strawberry fruits to go with a sweet citrus edge. The wine has good acidity, in a light apéritif style with pure final raspberry juice.",57.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Light pink in color, this is a bone-dry wine, with raspberry as well as an intense apple skin and grapefruit zest texture. A linear wine, very direct in its fruit character.",65.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A rich wine that parades great citrus and pear juice fruits to go with its intense texture of green apple skins and vivid acidity. It tastes very fresh, veering towards dry and could benefit from several months' bottle age. A step up in quality for this producer.",48.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Intensely liquorous, this is a wine whose richness comes from concentrated botrytis over honey and lemon acidity. It is very ripe, rather than hugely sweet, with a final burst of freshness, giving a positive lift. Delicious, it needs aging for 5–10 years.",42.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"The 80-acre Domaine de la Moussière is Alphonse Mellot's principal vineyard in Sancerre. This entry-level cuvée from the vineyard is already sumptuous enough, with fine, concentrated grassy flavors, laced with green apples, kiwi and citrus.",39.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Ripe and creamy, a classic sparkling Vouvray showing well in a cool year. It has weight and richness as well as fresh nuts and spice flavors, with just a touch of pepper. The acidity is well in balance.",19.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Made from old vines in a single vineyard, very intense even in its youth. It has a smooth, creamy texture over a core of flint and herbaceousness. It gradually builds, offering green and white fruits and vibrant acidity. This is a beautiful wine.",23.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A citrus-dominated wine, lime and lemon giving a crisp intensity. There is a somewhat bitter toast element, but the acidity, the fresh fruits and the soft structure act as a counter-balance. Give it six months to a year. Screwcap.",35.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Fresh, aromatic and fruity, it has ripe citrus and pear flavors layered with a more mineral, salty texture. It's tangy, full bodied and cut with tight acidity at the end.",20.00,Provence,Rolle
This is a fine entry-level rosé from this Provence classed-growth estate. It has fresh red fruits and a light texture that is rounded out with some concentration and almond flavors. Drink now.,40.00,Provence,Rosé
"A blend of Pinot Noir and Gamay, this is a rich wine, its fresh fruits layered with acidity, tight tannins and red currants. It is structured, with the flavors going right through the wine, leaving a full-bodied, ripe aftertaste.",25.00,Burgundy,Red_Blend
"Shows a distinctly ripe character in its warm tones of peach and brioche and a soft, creamy texture in the mouth. But there's also enough citrus and spice to provide balance and length on the finish.",20.00,Alsace,Sparkling_Blend
"Aromas of grass and herb are followed by fresh apple skin and green berry flavors. There is a definite edge of tannin, providing crisp freshness and a citric aftertaste.",17.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Lightweight, with more dryness than richness, this wine is lightly sweet, hinting at botrytis, with apple and cream flavors touched by honey.",21.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Densely tannic, this has edgy black currant flavor emerging between a firmly dry structure  packed with dark berry fruits and fresh acidity. This is light in fruit and heavy on tannins.",17.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The aromas and initial taste are all of new wood. Only later does some fresh red fruit appear, giving the wine a lift. There is enough fruit here, but this needs time for the wood to calm down. Then the wine will show the vibrancy the structure suggests.",24.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The Despagne family returned to tradition with the making of Girolate, planting a vineyard to the former high density, keeping winemaking simple. This is the 2003, the latest release. Reflecting the heat of that vintage, it is soft, textured, rich and spicy, with a southern warmth. Pure superripe Merlot.",90.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"On the dry side, the red cherry flavor is concentrated inside acidity and a fruit skin texture. Very fresh, very crisp, for food.",50.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"With the extra year of maturity, this is turning into a toast and spice wine, with the citrus fruit now softening into ripe apples and peaches. The acidity remains, giving a satisfactory jolt of final freshness. The wine's name means girl from Chaudoux, a small village near Sancerre.",33.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A full, ripe wine, with delicious white plum, sweet grapefruit and a tense mineral edge. There is a great texture from fruit tannins, boosted by intense shots of acidity. Age for another year or two.",32.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Unlike the heavily oaked Cuvée Crescendo produced from the same vineyard in 2005, this wine relies much more on ripe black fruits and open tannins. Certainly it has power, a broad and opulent character, the berry fruits jammy in their sweetness. Age 2–3 years.",42.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"There is some richness here, a wine that has sweet plum and spice flavors followed by a toasty character. The fruit has some stalkiness, while the acidity is very present. Could age well.",18.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"A classic, crisp, herbaceous style of wine that shows its green fruit, grassy character well. Grapefruit and other citrus flavors dominate, spiced with almond essence and a firm, green apple skin structure.",30.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Fresh grapefruit and textured apples and cream flavors dominate this finely made wine. The fruit is all there, very forward, crisp and herbaceous, ready to drink now with its soft finish.",25.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"An apple-fresh wine with attractive crisp acidity. The texture is of green apple skins followed by a firm, tight mouthfeel. The wine has a fine mineral edge, with a taut finish.",44.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Rich and powerful, this is a spicy wine flavored with caramel and apricot. There is a layer of high toast that is out of balance with the fruit, and needs time to calm down. Wait 6–9 months.",30.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Crisp and fruity, this wine demands to be drunk this summer. With bright red fruits, a light smoky texture and lime zest flavor, it is light, fresh and fragrant at the end.",15.00,Provence,Rosé
"Strong caramel aromas lead to a wine that is rich, vanilla-flavored with some attractive ripe strawberry flavors. It's soft and full in the mouth, revealing its acidity only at the end.",20.00,Provence,Rosé
"Ripe red fruits are the main character of this soft, rounded wine. Attractive acidity with grapefruit and lemon zest flavors are balanced by a warmer element.",17.00,Provence,Rosé
"Balancing fruit and ripe spice, it merits a place at the table rather than just serving as an apéritif. It has peach, lychee and a just off-dry character that allows for acidity. Drink now",25.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"Smooth, ripe and rounded, it's ready to drink with its light perfume and spice. Rich pear and quince fruits add freshness to the fullness. Drink now.",18.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"Pinker in color than many Provence rosés, this full-bodied wine has ripe strawberry fruits, rich acidity and a touch of caramel. With the weight and smooth texture, it will be better with food.",20.00,Provence,Rosé
"Rich in style, this full-bodied rosé boasts ripe red fruits and a rounded, smooth character. The lift from acidity gives essential freshness at the end.",17.00,Provence,Rosé
"While rich, this blend of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon is also quite herbal in character. Maybe it gets its nature from the wild garrigue countryside of Provence, but its tannins are firm and the fruit is laced with licorice. It should age another year.",30.00,Provence,Red_Blend
"Made by the Pauillac cooperative, this is a pleasant, lightweight wine, a surprise considering the vintage. There are black currant flavors, but the wood element is too dominant for the fruit.",30.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Although there is some structure, this wine is dominated by very fresh, crisp red fruits. Any depth of flavor comes from plum-skin tannins and some hints of spice.",21.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"A balanced, ripe wine, packed with pear skins, green apples and cream. It is delicate, with its acidity acting as a fresh, clean blast through the bubbles. Ends with that same freshness.",18.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Plum-jam-flavored wine, this is very sweet, rich and very direct. The freshness is here, but this is more about the dense, superripe fruits.",25.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"From 100% Pinot Noir, here is a delicious, crisp, wild raspberry- and mulberry-flavored wine. The acidity shines through the fruit skin texture, giving a mouthtingling feel.",23.00,Alsace,Pinot_Noir
"With a sweet dosage, this is soft Blanc de Blancs. Pears, hints of apricots go with some crisp acidity. It still tastes young and needs time to integrate, but will always be on the sweet side of Brut.",46.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Attractive strawberry flavors give this bright wine both softness and richness. It has a light bitter cherry character and balancing acidity, while finishing softly.",75.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This wine has a smoky character with aromas of wood smoke and autumnal apple orchards. The flavors are packed with herbs, very intense, needing 2–3 years to soften.",27.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A single estate run by Joseph Mellot, this produces an impressive ripe style of Sauvignon Blanc, at this stage youthful with exuberant white fruits and grapefruit, and an obvious need to age for 1–2 years.",20.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Dominated by fresh, bright, red cherry flavors, this is a deliciously fruity wine, structured with light tannins and added complexity from nutmeg, and a smoky, meaty edge.",40.00,Loire_Valley,Pinot_Noir
"From a vineyard that is being converted to biodynamic farming, here is a rich, dense wine, impressive for the year. The fruit is smoky, with bacon and dark plums over rich wood flavors. It's full in the mouth, the acidity sweet and balanced.",23.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"Young, dry Chenin, showing almond and marzipan paste flavors, the pear fruit coming through slowly. There is some pepper along with fresh acidity, which is still working its way into the wine. It needs a few months more to integrate completely, but then fruits should dominate.",20.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"An intensely perfumed wine that smells of a candy shop. It has tight acidity, but that is lost in the welter of white fruit flavors, allied with sweet wood. It seems at first too sweet, but then toast and acidity come in to give the wine an edgy finale.",60.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"The curse of Chanson's high toast for whites hits this wine. It is a shame, because once through the wood, the fruit is fresh and rounded, crispened but also given ripe white pear flavors.",115.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A soft wine, but with a crisp, creamy, fresh character underneath the surface. There are pear and citrus flavors, with an adjustment of toast. The soft theme continues on the light and fresh finish.",25.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Named after the highway that joins Paris and Provence, this a light and fruity wine, crisp yet with a soft aftertaste. It stays lively right to the end.",20.00,Provence,Rosé
"Fresh and fruity, this balances ripe red fruits with a touch of caramel and light, crisp acidity. It is fragrant and perfumed, and would make an excellent apéritif.",12.00,Provence,Rosé
"A light, refreshing sparkler with just a hint of toastiness, Ehrhart's Cuvée Prestige features hints of lemon and lime and a fresh, citrusy finish.",23.00,Alsace,Chardonnay
"This is the standard bearer of one of the top Saumur producers. It is pleasantly fresh and crisp, the white fruits showing well over the ripe, creamy texture. With its fine acidity, it leaves a crisp, mineral aftertaste.",14.00,France_Other,White_Blend
"Good structured fruit, with ripe sweet cherry flavors, appears alongside hints of raspberries. Fresh, but with some weight and solidity.",15.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"A very dry, tannic wine, full of dense structure. The fruit can be found underneath all this dryness, a layer of hedgerow blackberries, tight and firm. At the end, there is some baked acidity.",29.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"While this wine shows some of the softness and richness of 2003, it keeps a light touch and the acidity and black fruits remain fresh. There is an edge of astringency that leaves a hard aftertaste.",24.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Initially earthy, this needs a few minutes to blossom into an elegant, structured wine, with black cherry flavors, firm dry tannins and a smooth finish.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"This is big Fleurie, dominated by floral aromas and dry tannins at this stage, and therefore likely to develop for a year or two. The fruits are dark plum, full in the mouth. The acidity offers freshness but also adds to the weight of the texture.",17.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"A big, rich style of Sancerre, but one that doesn't forget its mineral, flinty roots. The acidity has an edge of sweetness, opened by delicious berry fruit flavors, tangy in its citrus freshness. It could age for another 1–2 years.",24.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"The Chenin Blanc shines here, with its smooth, creamy texture, hints of almonds, pears and an edge of firm texture. Acidity is balanced, a fine touch to finish a delicious wine.",25.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Green pear and quince flavors are found on a wine that has some richness. It is easy and soft initially, then a firm texture and the freshest acidity come through. But finally, it return to a rich character.",25.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"The vintage in Chablis seems to bring out both richness and minerality. That's certainly the combination here. The wine is full, with green plum juice followed by yellow peaches. At the core, though, is a tense, tight streak that comes from the chalk soil of the region, giving a firm structure.",24.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Typically Meursault with its fat fruit and texture, this is a wine that doesn't yet quite integrate. The problem is the excessive wood, which dominates the fruit, and gives tense acidity to the wine. It leaves intense spiciness, burnt toast flavors and a bitter, grapefruit flavor on the finish. Maybe in a few years.",130.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Warm while also fresh, this rounded wine is full of red fruits, lit up by a touch of spice and freshened with acidity. Clean and crisp, it's just bursting with fruit at the end.",10.00,Provence,Rosé
"This light-bodied sparkling wine features modest apple and citrus aromas and flavors but also a sense of earthiness. It doesn't seem quite as dry as some of its brethren, making it less zippy on the finish.",22.00,Alsace,Sparkling_Blend
"Light pink in color, this is a rosé for apéritif, for parties. With its fresh strawberry juiciness and light acidity, it floats easily and cleanly. The aftertaste leaves fine, fresh acidity.",17.00,France_Other,Red_Blend
"Made from Pinot Blanc, this is a plump Crémant with slightly floral aromas and lemon and lime flavors. Fresh, picking up some earthy aromas on the finish.",25.00,Alsace,Sparkling_Blend
"An intense, rounded wine, with fresh pear and apple flavors that offer freshness but also richness. Dry, but gives a softer side of Chenin, attractive now, but worth aging for 2–3 years.",16.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Stéphane Asséo, who also owns L'Aventure in Paso Robles, California, runs this estate as one of the star properties in Castillon. The wine is rich and plummy, with dense, soft fruit, dusty tannins, layers of new wood and ripe black fruits. Drink now, or keep for 2–3 years.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Black cherry and dark raspberry fruit blend with background citrus accents, leading into a vibrant but short finish. Drink now; may also be served slightly chilled.",15.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
This mevushal Cab exhibits strong dark fruit flavors of cassis and black cherry with a touch of burnt coffee.,13.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Cabernet_Sauvignon
"White, almost jammy fruits, mingle with acidity, minerality and tight tannins. This is a wine that offers spice, superrich fruit and intensity of flavor. Like all the wines produced by Nicolas Joly, this is made from biodynamically grown grapes, offering pure flavor and nothing else.",40.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Very perfumed Pinot Noir aromas, a wine that offers more than usual weight for a red Sancerre, as well as ripe plums and some sweetness. The texture is soft, juicy, only a touch of dry tannin at the heart, while the finish is all freshness and vivid berry acidity.",28.00,Loire_Valley,Pinot_Noir
"Spicy, smoky fruit, with soft tannins and a fresh tobacco aroma, this wine exhibits all the enticing characters of cool-climate Cabernet Franc. It is fresh, fruity, with cranberry juice tannins and alluring acidity.",16.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"Rounded, soft and spicy, this is a lively wine; not complex, just enjoyable. Lemon and white pear flavors are dominant, while the acidity is easy, fresh and textured by green apples.",35.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"The wood flavors smooth out this ripe green plum and apple wine, giving toast and caramel alongside the fruit. It has some crispness, but the main texture is round and soft.",30.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A fresh wine, all citrus and green plums, and rounded out with wood. This is an immediately attractive, thirst-quenching wine, with just a touch of sophistication.",30.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"From young vines (planted in 2001), this is a blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Sauvignon Gris, Sémillon and a small amount of Muscadelle. Marked by toast and vanilla, it's plump and round on the palate, finishing with some oaky spice. Imported by Bernard Magrez.",65.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Light, almost delicate wine, offering freshness, green fruits and a fine tangy texture. The citrus is prominent, but the wine as a whole is easy, fresh, developing quickly, touched finally with caramel.",23.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"An edgy, mineral style, full in the mouth, with fruit flavors that definitely go towards pear and apricot and away from herbaceous. It's a great style that allows the wine to age, with a firm texture to go with the fruit.",27.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"An impressively ripe wine, full of Cabernet Franc trademarks, such as spice, fruitcake and red berry fruits. It is structured, firm, hinting at wood, and finishing with bright acidity.",35.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"It is the blend of Malbec (Cot) and Cabernet Franc that gives this wine its intense, dry, tannic core. It is, though, all fruit as well, crisp plum skin textures and smoky black berry flavors. Despite the cooler year, this offers ripeness as well as taut, fresh acidity.",18.00,Loire_Valley,Red_Blend
"Grassy, smoky wine, with black plum skin tannins dominant. It has just enough warmth to balance the acidity, a wine that is black currant juicy and mineral, with a dry core.",9.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"A crisp, grassy, pure Sauvignon Blanc, which is fresh, acidic and offers great grapefruit flavors. There's a lightness that balances the fine depth of flavor from this leading Blaye property.",12.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"One of the most familiar Entre-deux-Mers chateaus, and certainly the largest, this is the home of master vigneron André Lurton. With its fresh, grapefruit flavors and aromas of white flowers and hedgerows, this is a great summer wine.",10.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"From the same stable as Clos Nardian and Le Dôme, this is a well-balanced wine, with grassy fresh flavors, and some good green fruit. The citrus element gives a great lift to the wine, leaving a delicious finish.",27.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"A fresh, fruity wine, with cigar and wood aromas, spice and light black fruits. This wine comes from before the renaissance that is taking place at Lascombes, and shows the lightness of the wines produced under the old ownership. It is balanced and fresh, with a good, dry aftertaste.",59.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A finely balanced Graves that shows wood, rich spice and toast as well as honey and smooth fruit flavors. It's an elegant, food-friendly wine. The release of this nearly 5-year-old wine shows just how well Graves wines can age.",16.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"This wine is fresh, with hints of ripe fruit and aromas of tobacco. It has some darkness, good black fruits and dark tannins, along with some good smoky wood.",35.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This relatively dark-colored rosé features nicely perfumed aromas of fruit blossoms and black cherries, then adds a hint of dark chocolate to the palate. It's fullish, but not heavy, balanced by some lemony notes on the finish.",13.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé
"Surprisingly good for its name, packaging and price, but that's why we taste the wines blind. On the dark side of copper, this wine shows floral and berry aromas and a touch of tree bark as well. Cherry-berry flavors are fresh and fruity, with a moderately long finish.",11.00,Rhône_Valley,Rosé
"Full-bodied and a bit heavy to make a delicate quaff, but pair this wine with the right summer foods (a juicy hamberger comes to mind) and it will work. Some tarry, meaty notes obscure what appears to be delicate cherry fruit that ends with a peppery tang.",12.00,Rhône_Valley,Rosé
"A cheery summer rosé, filled with simple, fruity flavors. Cherries, strawberries and melons finish in a soft mélange of fruit.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
"A clean, fresh, attractively rounded wine that's rich, buttery and demanding to be drunk. Vincent Bouzereau is one of the many Bouzereaus in Meursault with a tradition of grape growing over many generations.",49.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"An easy wine that's soft, fresh and simple, but one which has the merit of being drinkable and affordable. The yellow fruit flavors are rounded out with a touch of wood, and soft there's acidity to finish.",50.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Already, this is a drinkable wine, soft, lightly wooded, fresh and clean. There's attractive acidity to give the whole thing a lift.",48.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Starts with sweet scents of bread dough, light herb and green apple. Well-made, with lean, fresh flavors of apple and pear. The bubbles are extra fine, and the wine is crisp and balanced. For all its poise, it is a bit one-dimensional. A bracing style best-suited for salty, briny foods.",32.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is seriously dry, but not a serious wine. Its acidity, initially searing, parts to reveal crisp red berries and freshness. At the end, it has become sweeter, a light touch of sugar on the fruit.",17.00,France_Other,Red_Blend
"Once you cut through an astringent edge, this becomes a simple, fresh, fruity wine dominated by white fruit. There is attractive acidity, the crisp apple flavors layered with spice.",17.00,France_Other,White_Blend
"A wine for short-term aging, despite the relative lightness of the vintage and wine. It has firm tannins and dark berry fruits, layered with plum skins. The fruit sits on a base of tannins and acidity, while the surface remains bright and fresh.",20.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"A hugely black-colored, single-vineyard wine, heavily extracted and oaked, along with superripe plums fruit flavors. It is very dry, with powerful tannins, hopefully with the ability to become less aggressive. Age for 3–4 years.",85.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"Tannins dominate here, the fruit offering some bright support. The wine is certainly firm, although it misses some concentration. But it is well balanced, berry fruits showing well against a drier core. The aftertaste offers freshness and acidity. Drink over the next year.",19.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"Smooth, softly textured, going for the creamy side of Sauvignon Blanc. The wine has weight, flavors of toast and spice as well as ripe pink grapefruit. It is approaching maturity, but could age for another year.",33.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Wood-aged Sauvignon Blanc is always a difficult balancing trick. This wine, the top cuvée from Château de Sancerre, doesn't quite make it, with the spicy wood dominating the lighter fruit. The hints of fruit suggest pears and pink grapefruit, but always the wood intervenes.",33.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"lean, austere wine, that has dry tannins and flavors of stalky currants. It is pleasant enough, with some freshness, but there is a definite green element to it.",10.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Richly toasty, showing hints of brioche dough and French toast on the nose, then delivering toast, apple and citrus flavors in a medium-weight format. Finishes dry, crisp and lemony. A solid choice in NV brut.",43.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is a big, rich wine, but with the fresh acidity that seems to be a hallmark of the 2004 whites. There are flavors of lime and grapefruit, and a layer of tannin to give this delicious wine good structure.",13.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"A well-balanced wine with dry fruits, flavors of black currants and fine, fresh fruit. It is not a big wine, but benefits from elegance and freshness. It is ready to drink now.",28.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A full, very low-acid wine, thanks to the hot summer. To compensate, though, there are fine wood and tropical fruit flavors, which lend spice and an exotic element to the wine. Unlike the 2002 from the same property, this wine should be drunk soon",22.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Light and coppery, this easy-sipping rosé offers clean, simple flavors of cherry and berry candy. The fine bubbles give the mouthfeel a welcome elegance. The fruit flavors are also pretty, but diffuse. It falls off quickly on the finish, leaving just the slightest impression of brine.",40.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Creamy wine, flavored with pears, almonds and crisp acidity. The wine is taut and crisp at the same time. The aftertaste, otherwise fresh, is spoilt by a yeasty bitterness.",17.00,France_Other,White_Blend
"Soft, sweet and full-bodied, this sparkler is a Christmas party number, its freshness masked by strawberry and sugar flavors. The aftertaste is verging on bitter.",16.00,France_Other,Red_Blend
"This particular estate is small but has produced some good, solidly juicy ripe wine, with big black fruit and mocha flavors.",32.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Certainly an attractive presentation with its cute pink heart on the label, this is also an attractive, finely structured wine which brings together some good tannins and ripe fruits, a hint of licorice and fresh acidity.",18.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"A rich wine, with a precise texture that offers layers of acidity. The fruit flavors are likely to open out this year, already hinting at peach juice richness.",27.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Ripe and soft, with smooth toast-inspired texture and blackberry fruits on the rich side. It is still young, needing another year to pull firmly together, but its elegance already shows.",42.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"Taut wine, showing very mineral character, steely and crisp, the intensity building as it opens up. It has a vivid citrus character, finishing with bright but not weighty acidity.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A pure strawberry jam wine, its ripe fruit scintillating with freshness and acidity. The wine is also round, with tannins giving some weight. The aftertaste is deliciously fruity.",17.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"Hints of espresso and black olive on the nose give an earthy cast to the black cherry and berry flavors. A bit rustic and lacking depth, but this is a decent effort from a tough vintage. Drink now.",35.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"A quite green style of Champagne, very clean and very crisp. From one of the Champagne cooperatives, this is a great value wine, with pleasing freshness. Imported by Grape Expectations of Georgia.",38.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"91-93 Barrel sample. There's beautiful fruit here: vibrant black plums and a touch of cinnamon. This has real Margaux elegance and character, with a fresh style, just supported by open tannins. Lascombes seems to be coming into its own at last.",59.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The rare white wine from Chateau Mouton Rothschild is a creamy, full-bodied blend of 48% Semillon, 38% Sauvignon Blanc and 14% Muscadelle. Toast and mushroom scents merge easily into buttered stone-fruit flavors on the palate, finishing on a weighty note.",50.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"A big rich, well-made wine that comes from Soussans in the north of Margaux appellation. It is solid, with some new wood flavors, black fruits and tarry tannins that leave a firm, dry aftertaste.",22.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Shows a fair amount of toasty, vanilla-scented oak, but its well balanced by cassis and tobacco notes. Medium-to-full-bodied, with a supple mouthfeel and dusty earth and tobacco flavors. Ripe cherry fruit comes through on the finish, suggesting that better things may emerge in another couple of years.",45.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A well-flavored, well-structured wine, which emphasizes Margaux elegance. Flavors of black currant, Mediterranean herbs and spices are all harmonious. It may not be a big wine, but it has richness, light tannins and good intensity.",30.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A crisp, fresh wine, ready to drink now, with no wood aging, but with great ripe white-fruit flavors, and  mouth-watering acidity. A great apéritif wine for the summer.",12.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"This is an exceptional wine, as is the vintage. The fruits—grapefruit, crisp red apple—balance with a fine yeasty character. There is a great depth of flavor, the fruits going in a pure line of freshness. The one problem is that it is much too young, the result of the demand from the market for the next vintage. Age this wine for at least four years.",289.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Even at 10 years, this is still just setting out. While it doesn't have the immensity of the 1996, it has a great intense grapefruit, pear and fresh apricot series of flavors that come through with toast, ripeness and a suggestion of almonds. 7–8 years aging.",275.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"The fabled Salon's latest release is much riper and softer than the great steely 1996 vintage. This suggests it is likely to be ready to drink soon. In the meantime, the acidity is supremely fresh, with grapefruit edges and green apple flavors. And then there is minerality and a tight, structured aftertaste as a reminder that this great Champagne is always going to be more than its fruit.",400.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Orange-pink in color, this a super-rich rosé. The flavors are of orange zest, citrus and red currants, with a beautiful contrast of hazelnuts. The texture, round and succulent, is still able to offer minerality and a crisp aftertaste.",505.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"The purity of this wine is impressive. It has a straight line of mineral, flint and grapefruit running through it. Around this, there are layers of fresh apples, lime zest and a tight, taut structure. The one downside to what is a fine wine is that it, like many Roederer vintages, is too young. Give it 4–5 years.",70.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"With a majority of Chardonnay in the blend, this has turned into a wonderfully expressive wine. It is more open than the great 1996, more generous, giving some mature toast and nut flavors, but still retaining ripe apricots and mulberry. In the Jacquesson style, this is very dry, but its richness keeps it well in balance.",165.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is a classic Dom Pérignon vintage. It's big and fruity initially, a mouthful of ripeness. Then the texture and structure of this dense wine come through. It's as much wine as Champagne, rich, the apple and fresh pear flavors vying with yeasty and a tense crispness. Worth aging, it will be even better in 3–4 years.",150.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This Krug vintage is showing some maturity, especially from its toast aroma. But certainly not too much maturity, because on the palate the fruit remains young at heart, a crisp burst of freshness coming through the more mature acidity. All the elements are in balance, making a finely shaped wine, which impresses as much from its elegance as from its richness.",350.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Unusual for Bordeaux, this chateau's plantings contain 20% Malbec, imparting a strong blackberry character to the wine. There's smoky oak, too, and intriguing spice and juiciness on the finish. Imported by Bernard Magrez.",32.00,Bordeaux,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Fine ripe fruit here, with plenty of sweet apple and pear flavors. The wine is ripe, soft, open, maybe lacking concentration but with a great tangy herbaceous character. Screwcap.",20.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A rounded, generous wine that shows red plums, fresh red berry acidity, but also a layer of tannins. That puts it into a food-friendly category, full of flavor and fruit, but also well structured.",19.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"There is a good depth of red fruit flavor here, along with a touch of tannins, a granite feel to the structure, but also an open acidity. The wine has a delicious, fresh and juicy finish.",23.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"Almost searingly fresh, this is a wine that demands fish. The acidity is dominant, cutting through the grapefruit and green fruit flavors. With its tight texture, this could age for a few more months, but it will be great this summer.",13.00,Loire_Valley,Melon
"Attractively rich and smooth, a wine that shows some good dense fruits, almost velvet tannins and fine flavors of black plums. It's mature now, with a good spice and leather character. Screwcap.",20.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet
"Given the crispness of much white Loire 2007, this vintage of demi-sec from Domaine du Petit Coteau is better than the sec. It just needs that flavor of white pear juice, smoothing out the acidity, emphasizing nuts, with the taut, mineral structure an added complexity.",19.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"An impressive wine, packed with concentrated white and green fruits. It has  good structure, fresh acidity and a touch of toastiness. It's a dry wine, but full and rich, and likely to age well over the next couple of years. Imported by P. Comms International.",24.00,Burgundy,Champagne_Blend
"A simple, fresh rosé, which has some attractive toasty bottle age. There is also a yeasty character, which leaves the fruit submerged in the more autolytic flavors. This is a fine rosé for food. Imported by Tri-Vin Imports.",40.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A simple, fresh style of wine, with attractive white currant flavors and good acidity. This Charles Lafitte brand describes itself as the successor to the George Goulet label, whose wines are now made elsewhere. Imported by Vranken America.",32.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A simple, fresh, citrusy wine with attractive floral aromas. There are flavors of kiwis and white peaches, which give an attractive lift.",10.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Named after a low-lying vineyard in alluvial soil, his white is soft and very ripe, with quince flavors and a light touch of wood.",14.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"This 61-acre estate was bought in 1981. This white is a beautifully crafted wine, layering cream, vanilla and pink grapefruit flavors. It is rich, ripe and ready to drink now.",14.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"This single-vineyard Champagne is always at the summit in Champagne. The 1998 is just at the moment when the fresh fruits move into maturity. There is toast, almond and marzipan, while at the same time pink grapefruit crispness is still there. Drink it now for freshness; keep for many years for maturity.",225.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"N.P.U. standing for Nec Plus Ultra (translation “nothing further beyond”), this is a ultra-dry Champagne. It needs time to mature, so Bruno Paillard is to be congratulated for only now releasing the 1995 vintage. It has richness and freshness, the white fruits still scintillating in the glass. With the acidity over the ripe fruits, this could certainly age over the next five years or more.",220.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Jacquesson is proud possessor of top quality grand cru vineyards in Avize. This vintage is subtle, a wine that takes a while to show all its richness, balanced with elegance. The fruit is ripe pear, peach and orange zest. It has a great streak of minerality. Worth aging.",125.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"One of the grandest single vineyards in Champagne, an immensely steep south-facing hillside that dominates Mareuil-sur-Aÿ. From here, Philipponnat is able to produce powerful wines with toasty, ripe fruit, powered with yeast and flavors of hazelnuts and white fruits. While not as tense and without the aging potential of 1998, this is without doubt a great Champagne.",200.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Femme is Duval-Leroy's top cuvée. This, from the great 1996 vintage, is as much wine as sparkling experience. It has great depth of flavor and a powerful steely background, with tight acidity. The grapefruit flavor is only superficial, because behind this crispness, the wine shows considerable richness.",110.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is all about great fruit bursting out of the glass. Red fruits dominate, with smooth tannins in support. There is a density at the heart of the wine, layered with fresh acidity. Drink now, but will age over 2–3 years.",15.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Classic ripe apples and pear fruits with a healthy serving of acidity, this is concentrated with a strong element of minerality. It has fine weight and richness.",26.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A light, frothy style of Champagne, fresh and crisp with a high proportion of Pinot Noir in the blend, giving quite tight acidity in the aftertaste. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",40.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A rich, toasty wine, packed with mature fruit. With fine acidity piercing through flavors of pear and almonds, this is more impressive than most inexpensive Champagnes. Imported by Robert Kacher Imports.",20.00,Alsace,Champagne_Blend
"This is a great, concentrated wine, which packs clean, almond, kiwi and apple flavors along with a creamy, rich mousse and delicious acidity. This is a wine that can age well—a 1996 was still fresh when tasted early in 2006. Imported by Louis Dressner Selections.",17.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"A serious, intensely fruity wine that shows great depth of flavor, some good tannic structure and fine, long-lasting acidity. With its delicate mousse, it could  age for two more years in bottle. Multiple U.S. importers.",19.00,Burgundy,Sparkling_Blend
"A light, easy wine with some fresh green fruits. It is ready to drink. A soft, friendly wine.",63.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A yellow straw shade, with a somewhat beery, sulphury scent. It's better in the mouth, where it's spicy and yeasty. But the beery quality persists right through the finish. It leaves a slightly sour flavor long after being swallowed, like a bite of sourdough bread.",33.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is traditional winemaking, but done well. It is a pleasant, easy wine, one that shows good structure. Ready to drink, but should develop over 5 years.",30.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A small parcel of vines belonging to Château Peyrabon are in Pauillac and these are vinified separately as Fleur Peyrabon. This 2002 is piled with wood, dense tannins and dryness. What is missing at this stage is fruit, which is submerged by the dryness and tannins.",27.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Named after the 18th-century founder of Château Lynch-Bages, this branded white Bordeaux has attractive, simple grapefruit and white-peach flavors. It is full, but crisp, a good example of well-made white Bordeaux.",10.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"The beautiful orange pink sunrise color sets the scene for a dry style of wine, very much in the Laurent-Perrier tradition. Flavors of crisp red apples, red berry fruits and white currants come together with an edge of toast. A great wine, and a real food Champagne.",300.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A powerful wine that is very ripe and soft. What makes it work so well is the toast, the acidity from a high proportion of Pinot Noir, and the dense, full structure. This is, without question, a food wine. It should also age over 4–5 years at least.",100.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Only disgorged in 2007, this fine vintage wine has preserved all its freshness. There are white fruits, pear juice, a crisp texture. They combine well to create a wine with considerable minerality, flinty, but full in the mouth. Age over the next 4–5 years.",75.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A remarkable wine that manages effortlessly to bring together ripe apricot and sweet pear flavors with a balanced maturity that is so delicious. It has power and richness, but there is also minerality and a hint of a chalky texture. This 1999 needs less aging than previous vintages and can be drunk now.",128.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"From start to finish, this top quality vintage follows a straight line. It starts with freshness and explodes into richness. The initial very tight structure soon opens out with white pears and green plums, soft and ripe. The fruit is supported by the structure which offers orange zest. Like many 1999s, this is almost ready to drink.",103.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A great Champagne, rich and full-bodied, with a fine mineral streak and almost of austerity that demands aging. It is tight on the structure, yet ripe on the mature fruit, which is changing into its secondary toast, walnut and quince. It could still age over five years or more.",95.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A Champagne that is very much wine. The structure and the richness are just right for a food wine, showing ripe acidity, flavors of plums and apricots, and balancing these primary fruits with a dense, complex structure that takes in yeast, maturity and a tight apple skin finish.",100.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"You can tell that Pinot Noir dominates this wine. It is big, powerful, hinting at raspberries as well as delicious richness. There are white peach and pink grapefruit flavors, but the yeast and the layers of structured toast are just as intriguing. The final is a play on richness and structure.",55.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Now that it is owned by Bollinger, Ayala is returning to form. The style of this prestige cuvée is mature and dry, a fresh yeasty character showing against toastiness and pink grapefruit acidity. The finish is very crisp and dry.",120.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Caramel and toast aromas lead to a wine where wood is, surprisingly for Sancerre, an important element. It has weight, a creamy texture, suggestions of mellow peaches, soft and ripe.",29.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"While there is a fine citrus element here, the texture also has some creamy richness. However, the almost salty character of the wine certainly places it near the ocean. Drink this year.",16.00,Loire_Valley,Melon
"Classic ripe Muscadet, ripe but fresh, steely around the edges with delicious fresh fruits in the center. It is a lively wine, flavored with grapefruit and white currants, with an apple skin texture.",16.00,Loire_Valley,Melon
"A soft, ripe, creamy style that then tightens up with a strong herbaceous currant fruit flavor. It is intense, rich and concentrated, lemon and fresh white peaches combining easily.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Quarts de Chaume, producing botrytized Chenin Blanc, should be one of the glories of the Loire. This example from Château Belle Rive, is only half there. Its rich, almost toffee character is certainly super-sweet, but it misses on the acidity, which is an essential part of the character. Too velvet for its own good.",40.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Attractive, ripely structured Sauvignon Blanc with a touch of herbaceousness and layered richness from apricot and green plum flavors. There is a good, green fruit structure to hold it all together.",17.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Perfumed Chenin Blanc, honey and almonds followed by fresh, creamy apples. There is a fruit skin edge, giving a tannic structure, but it is mainly crisp, ready to drink.",12.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"A tight wine, with bitter cherry flavors and a lightness that gives easy, fresh drinking. The year, 2007, doesn't lend itself to a rich red Sancerre, but this brings out the freshness of the year well.",74.00,Loire_Valley,Pinot_Noir
"Crisply made, herbaceous Sauvignon Blanc, relishing hedgerow fruits, green, crisp berries and a creamy texture. Pure fruit drives the wine, the structure coming from acidity and pear skins.",25.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Herb tea and white flower aromas give this wine a fine start. The Chardonnay flavors are all there: a touch of vanilla, some almonds, and pears. Fresh and  rich. Could age for a couple of years. Multiple U.S. importers.",19.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"By far the best wine in the Louis Bouillot range, this is full, crisp and layered with toastiness. It has taken on flavors of honey, spices and vanilla from its wood aging. A fine wine, dry to taste and finishing crisp and full-bodied. Imported by Boisset America.",16.00,Burgundy,Champagne_Blend
"This is a ripe, creamy blend of Chenin Blanc, with 20% Chardonnay and 20% Cabernet Franc. Aged on its lees for 20 months, it has a smooth, open mousse, fine, full pear fruit flavors and a touch of mature toast. It is delicious, ripe and elegant. Imported by Paterno Wines International.",21.00,Loire_Valley,White_Blend
"With its source of grapes from northern Burgundy, this cool, collected wine is as close to Champagne in taste as is possible. Balancing Chardonnay with some Aligoté, it is the richness of the Chardonnay that wins out, giving a ripe, creamy wine that could benefit from some bottle age. Imported by Vitis Imports.",19.00,Burgundy,Sparkling_Blend
"Branded Bordeaux has a deservedly spotty reputation, but this year's Mouton Cadet aims to start turning that around. Cherries and chocolate on the nose, followed by smoky, earthy tobacco and black-cherry flavors. A silky texture makes it ready to drink now.",8.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A well-made, fresh, fruity wine, straightforward but ready to drink. Light, forward fruits and sweet spice layer over dusty, woody tannins. The wine is ripe and developing well.",27.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This wine has pleasant, fresh fruit, some good tannins and ripe fruit. It is soft, with forward fruits, and a simplicity that makes it ready to drink now.",30.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Already showing some bricking at the rim, this St.-Emilion from the owner of Château Pavie is altogether different from that storied wine. Starts with scents of raisins, smoke and leather, and continues in that vein on the palate, where the flavors run toward dried fruit and vanilla. Supple, soft tannins on the finish suggest early drinkability.",40.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Another novelty white wine from a property better known for its Pauillac, the blend here is 40% Semillon, 40% Sauvignon Blanc and 20% Muscadelle. It's light in body, offering up grassy notes of apple, mineral and just hints of buttered toast. The mouthwatering finish is its best feature, picking up subtle wood tones.",38.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"A soft, ready-to-drink Margaux, with scents of damp clay and leather followed by black cherry and vanilla flavors. Boasts a plesant creaminess on the palate and complicating hints of leather and earth on the finish.",45.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A supple, easy-drinking claret, with cedar, vanilla and cherry notes all sweeping across the palate and finishing with dusty, soft tannins. Drink now.",15.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Aromas of nuts and honey, with smooth, soft flavors. This wine has ripeness along with crisp acidity. It is pure in fruit, without a hint of wood.",12.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Citrus aromas and grapefruit flavors make this fresh, simple wine pleasing and attractive. This wine shows a style that has made Chablis so popular around the world.",19.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"What a creamy Champagne, its mousse bursting around the mouth. Impressively, all this creaminess is well balanced by full, dry fruits, flavors of pear and fresh bread and finished with crisp apples. This is not a wine for aging, but it is ready to go with many meals now.",70.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Moët's vintage, from the hot, low-yielding 2003 vintage, has an unusually high percentage of Pinot Meunier (43%), suggesting there is a distinct character to the year. It's certainly powerful and intense, soft initially, hinting at toast and yeast, the fruit almost sweet, even though the wine is a brut style. It is the rich strawberry flavor that's most surprising on a wine that really has integrated impressively.",65.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A ripe, soft wine that still does manage to preserve the Ayala lightness of touch. The fruit is green apple and pink grapefruit, with great freshness. The structure, though, is open and hints of yeast show through the fruit. The aftertaste is deliciously fresh.",65.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A pure, fresh line runs through this delicate rosé. It shows more white fruits than red, just hinting at red currants, but more of fresh white berries. There is just some hint of sweetness, more from the fruit of 2003 than from any extra dosage.",70.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A fresh, grassy, herbal wine, with great crisp acidity and intense Sauvignon Blanc flavors. It floats acidity and green flavors along with full, rich fruit. The Chantegrive estate is one of the most important in the southern Graves, an example of what can be done in the region, given investment. Screwcap.",18.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"A smooth creamy textured wine, the fruit flavors softened by ripeness and an edge that is just sweet. Good acidity gives it a fresh streak, the flavors of white currants, green plums and grapefruit coming out of a smoky edge. Screwcap.",25.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Albrecht obviously has a skill in sparkling wines, because this, like its partner rosé, is skillfully made, full of fruit and richness.

"From this quality producer, known for his grand cru wines from Schlossberg and Hengst, this is a crisp, beautiful wine that shines with fruit, structure and liveliness. It is delicate, elegant and a great apéritif wine. Imported by Weygandt-Metzler.",22.00,Alsace,Sparkling_Blend
"This is a fine, mature wine, showing delicious toasty characters, mature fruit and a long, fine line of bubbles. Full-bodied but crisp, it has complex flavors of pears and almonds, plus some minerality. Good as an apéritif wine, but even better with food. Imported by W.J. Deutsch & Sons.",20.00,Alsace,Sparkling_Blend

"The Toques et Clochers is the special selection of top wines made each year by the Sieur d'Arques cooperative.

Imported by Wine Symphony.",15.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Sparkling_Blend
"This sparkling wine is the only one made in the Chablis region. That's a shame, because with its great toasty character, crisp yellow fruit flavors and its beautifully delicate mousse, there should be more like it in Chablis. Imported by Louis Latour Inc.",13.00,Burgundy,Champagne_Blend
"Tight, crisp, dry, full of ultra-fresh apples, this is a pure wine, its fruit from biodynamic grapes, its flavors showing apple skin, grapefruit zest and an edge of green almonds. It needs 2–3 years at least.",19.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Chalky in texture, the wine has an edgy texture lightened by sweet currant flavors. It has freshness from sweet apple acidity, the sweetness kept in check by minerality and structure.",14.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Initially, the creaminess dominates. Then the crisp, green pea flavor and tight, structured acidity comes through for a cool, mineral, pink grapefruit-edged wine.",13.00,Loire_Valley,Melon
"This 100% Sauvignon Blanc is a fresh, delicious summer wine. It is light and clean, with flavors of mango and citrus and a flowery feel. Acidity gives it a great lift to the finish.",10.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"A usually reliable performer, Patache d'Aux produced a solid wine in the difficult 2002 vintage. A whiff of mint carries through on the palate, which blends herbs, berries and vanilla in a straightforward claret. Fruit shows through the firm tannins on the finish, suggesting this will improve over the next few years. Drink 2008–2012.",22.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Great green apples and white fruits dominate this intense, mineral wine. There is some power, but the wine also floats easily over its structure, enhanced by the appetizing aftertaste. This is for food.",72.00,Champagne,Chardonnay

"Soft, ripe, smoky wine, with cinnamon spice that overlay the intense berry fruits. With its freshness, its core of dry tannin and flavorsome acidity, this is ready to drink now.",18.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"Open, tropical Sauvignon, with mango and lychee flavors, ripe, soft and very cleanly made. A pleasure to drink as an apéritif, the edge of acidity and texture holding all the ripe fruit flavors together.",13.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"The Xavier Flouret range includes wines from both Spain and France. This expression of French Sauvignon Blanc is maturing well, its primary grassy character softened by flavors of almond paste, the acidity tamed but still pulsating through the wine. There is a good apple skin texture to add complexity.",23.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc

"This plump, low-acid white boasts plenty of pear flavors on the palate. Finishes with a touch of citrus—just enough to provide life to the flavors. Drink now.",14.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"A second label of the famous second growth, Chateau Gruaud Larose, this wine offers charming scents of cherries, cedar and herb, but clamps down on the palate with dusty, slightly drying tannins that don't appear to have the depth of fruit to support them for long-term aging. Drink over the next few years with rare beef or lamb to help rein in the tannins.",50.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Creamy-textured in the mouth, this is an easy-to-drink bubbly that will satisfy the demands of any informal summer garden gathering. Flavors are of apples and pears, berries and cream; dry enough to serve with food, soft enough to serve on its own.",8.00,France_Other,Sparkling_Blend

"With three years of bottle age, this is a sophisticated wine, ripe and soft, with a creamy mousse. The 30% Cab Franc (blended with Chenin Blanc and Chardonnay) gives flavors of raspberry fruits.

"Emphasizing the stalkiness of Cabernet Franc, with some smoky flavors and tight, dry tannins, this wine needs a few more months to bring out the berry fruits underneath. The balance, though, is potentially good, with fine fresh acidity.",16.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"Mature already, displaying leather, earth and tobacco nuances on the nose, followed by flavors of black cherry and tobacco. Light-bodied, with a juicy, mouthwatering finish. Drink over the next 2-3 years.",22.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Zesty and clean, with scents of green apple and fresh straw that give way to flavors of grapefruit and herbs. Citrusy and fresh on the finish, but ultimately a little simple. Try with oysters or other simple seafood items.",12.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Turns citrusy and tart on the finish, but this is a decent little claret nonetheless. Smells just right, with cedar, vanilla and cherries combining on the nose, then delivers a light, satiny-smooth mouthful of tart berries and vanilla flavor.",15.00,Bordeaux,Merlot-Cabernet_Sauvignon
"A subsidiary label of Chateau Gruaud Larose, obviously destined for earlier drinking than the grand vin. Supple tannins frame cedar, tobacco and earth notes, while the light frame holds just enough flesh to avoid leanness.",45.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"As befits its provenance from the hands of the winemaking team of Château Haut-Brion, this is a solid, finely crafted wine, flavored with mint and layers of wood as well as red plums. With these tannins, it could even age a year or 2.",22.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A solid yet seductive wine, displaying a handsome bouquet of sour cherry, licorice, meat and leather aromas. The mouth follows in good style with riper cherry fruit, cocoa-chocolate notes and an anise touch that adds dimension. The rich, full palate texture and long finish with its dusty tannins complete the pretty picture. Cellar Selection.",45.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Attractive salmon pink color, fresh raspberry flavor and lively acidity: it's all there with this deliciously, crisp, summertime rosé. There is just a touch of toastiness to give it some complexity, but freshness and openness are the main characters of this wine. Imported by Vitis Imports.",19.00,Burgundy,Champagne_Blend
"A ripe, creamy, toasty wine which has some mature oxidation that enhances the wine. Shows that Jura's sparkling wines have the ability to age. But do enjoy it this year—it won't age further.",24.00,France_Other,Sparkling_Blend
"A 100% Chardonnay that is rich, with a creamy feel and flavors of tropical fruits. It is full and food-friendly with a dry aftertaste, and a touch of almonds. Imported by Kobrand.",17.00,Loire_Valley,Chardonnay
"This is a medium-sweet rosé, with flavors of sugared strawberries, always freshened with fragrant acidity. It is fresh and lively, a delicate, low alcohol summer apéritif wine.",10.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"A soft, relatively ripe style of Sauvignon Blanc, moving towards white fruits, even hints of lychee spice. But the wine also has an herbaceous element, showing young, green plum juiciness. It is simple,fresh and attractive to drink now. Screwcap.",16.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"The Loire produces a crisp style of Chardonnay, and this one emphasizes fresh lime and other citrus flavors. It has structure, a crisp core of pear skins with a floral, green finish.",10.00,Loire_Valley,Chardonnay
"Yes, that Mouton Cadet has been transformed into a clean fresh wine featuring notes of apple and citrus and touches of earth and herb. A blend of 50% Semillon, 40% Sauvignon Blanc and 10% Muscadelle.",8.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Offers up decent aromas of sour cherries, then folds in leather and earth notes on the palate. This is an easy-to-drink claret for immediate consumption—little tannin, some coffee, tart cherries for balance.",10.00,Bordeaux,Cabernet_Sauvignon
"Quite minty and herbal, but balanced somewhat by cherry, blackberry and vanilla flavors. A medium-weight quaffer with a fresh, cinnamon note to the finish.",15.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Begins with modest apple and nectarine scents, then delivers bland stone fruit flavors in a plump, low-acid format that's easy to drink, as long as it's well chilled. Shows the ripeness of the 2003 vintage, but lacks concentration.",10.00,Bordeaux,Sauvignon_Blanc-Semillon
"La Tour Carnet is a reliable cru bourgeois; this second wine is correspondingly less impressive. The aromas are muted, and the flavors tend toward earthy notes and sour cherries, with rugged tannins on the finish.",29.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"From the same stable as Château Lynch-Bages, this is superior branded Bordeaux. It is fruity, ripe, full-bodied with solid dense tannins. An impressively powered wine, with some fresh black currant flavor and acidity.",11.00,Bordeaux,Merlot
"A dark, dense wine, still very young, but already supple. Merlot was ripe in 2004 and this wine shows it in its opulence and richness. Yet there are tannins here, so drink now, and age over the next 5 years. A great value for a Pomerol.",23.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Magrez calls wines like this 75% Merlot, “the future of midpriced Bordeaux.” It's lush and ripe, with black cherry and mocha shadings, and only a hint of herbaceousness. Not overly rich or tannic, it should drink well for the next 5–8 years. Imported by Bernard Magrez.",24.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This is young, dominated by some spicy wood and quite densely textured fruit and tannin. Impressive for a branded wine, all vibrant fruit, balanced by a firm, dry structure, and with a rich aftertaste. Age this for at least 1 year.",24.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Aromas of clove, strong, spicy oak and sublimated cherry open this hard-to-decipher wine. Large-scaled, with a full mouthfeel, there's no nuance to read, but we caught a faint glimpse of fruit up front and sensed lovely mineral elements below the surface later. Tight now, but time will tell.",65.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This shows class and style immediately in its dry black cherry and soft leather aromas with chalk nuances on the nose. Opens with even, elegant cherry fruit; spice and leather accents atop a supple palate follow. The wine finishes gracefully, with good length and a sweet back-bouquet.",57.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Very fresh and crisp, with some good structure, this fine wine has apple and kiwi flavors and a touch of toast, caramel and lively acidity. Muré also owns Clos Saint-Landelin in Rouffach, one of the top Alsace vineyards. Imported by Robert Kacher Imports.",20.00,Alsace,Champagne_Blend
"A classic Champagne blend of Chard and Pinot Noir gives this wine some good depth and ripe flavors. Has flavors of toast, spices and pears as well as some good tannin structure. The finish is dry, with just a hint of softness. Imported by Boisset America.",15.00,Burgundy,Champagne_Blend
"Chenin Blanc makes delicious sparkling wine when the producer tames its high acidity. This wine has a fine, fresh, Gala apple flavor, crisp but not overpowering acidity, and a layer of almonds. Imported by Chicago Wine Merchant.",15.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"A fine apple-and-cream wine that bounces with freshness and liveliness. There might not be complexity, but this is definitely a wine that gives great, fruity pleasure. Imported by Cannon Wines Limited.",17.00,Burgundy,Champagne_Blend
"Incredibly rich, velvety-textured and long, this is a great example of Hermitage from a superripe vintage. It's dense like fruitcake without being excessively heavy, and boasts such a panopoly of nuance as to be spellbinding, ranging from spice and herb to black olive and espresso. Wow! Drink now–2025.",146.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"With its tobacco and fresh raspberry aromas, this is a light, perfumed, smoky wine of fragrant Cabernet Franc with a touch of blueberry tannins and an intense burst of finishing acidity.",14.00,Loire_Valley,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A very soft, immediately attractve wine with flavors of honey and baked apple. There is a hint of almond underlying the tight texture. The finish, though, is rounder, with a full, almost green olive oil finish.",16.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Soft, rather bland wine, which seems to play down the crispness of good Chenin in favor of a wood-dominated style. Baked apple and cream flavors are present, with some juicy green plum acidity somewhere in the background.",12.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"An earthy, easy wine that shouts of fresh Sauvignon Blanc, with its crisp acidity, grassy aromas and green fruit flavors. Just bottled, it will stay at peak freshness during the summer months.",9.00,Bordeaux,Sauvignon
"Grass and herb aromas vie with earthier, chalky nuances in this lithe little sipper. Lime and green apple fruit dominate the palate, which finishes crisp and clean, if a bit short.",12.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Magrez purchased this estate in 2003, so this is the first vintage he's had complete control. Primarily a blend of Sémillon and Sauvignon Gris, it's fresh and apple-y, with hints of grapefruit and lime. Finishes long and crisp. Imported by Bernard Magrez.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Made mainly from Chardonnay, this poised sparkling wine is deliciously crisp, packed with flavors of red apples and aromas of hedgerow flowers.",20.00,France_Other,Sparkling_Blend
"At five years of age, this is still a young wine, keeping much of its appeal firmly under wraps. The tight aromas and flavors only gradually reveal hints of their future grandeur in tantalizing glimpses of honey, anise, orange peel and pineapple. Yet the neverending length and pronounced minerality to this wine's finish leaves no doubt of its ultimate quality. Try after 2010?",134.00,Rhône_Valley,Marsanne
"A tour de force from the 2004 vintage, combining the floral and spice hallmarks of the year's moderate temperatures with deftly polished structure and weight. Raspberry and blackberry flavors are bold and rich, while the tannins are strong yet supple. Drink–through 2020.",75.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"A blend of one-third each Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah, year-in and year-out this is among Lirac's top wines, if not the top. In 2003, it's rich, ripe and a touch alcoholic, but still boasts well-defined aromas of plum and spice. In the mouth, it's like liquid chocolate fudge--velvety, yet never ponderous or heavy. Ready to drink now, but should last up to 10 years.",39.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A bit closed on the nose, but the potential of this wine is obvious. Crafted from 110-year-old Grenache, the flavors are intense, bathing the palate in layers of plum pudding, anise and chocolate. A huge wine in need of at least five years. Owner Louis Barruol suggests 15 years may be a better bet.",50.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Saint Cosme assembles this wine from seven different parcels and gives it a relatively short (2 week) maceration. The result is a wine of exceptional complexity and finesse, starting with delicate herb and violet aromas. Red plum and stone fruit flavors take hold of the midpalate, yet there's always an intriguing spice note in the background. Rich, yet fresh, with great length. Drink now–2015.",65.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"This domaine's luxury cuvée shines in 2003, offering a lovely bouquet that balances spice, leather and dried fruits. Shows the plus side of the 2003 vintage in its great concentration, yet it doesn't seem overdone at all. Plum, black cherry and spice: this wine has it all. Drink now–2015. Tasted twice, with consistent notes.",28.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Bursts with bold pepper and raspberry aromas and flavors, but they're elegant as much as they're potent. Powerful fruit, supple tannins and a long, structured finish make this one of the top Saint-Josephs. Drink now–2015.",64.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Obviously not in the first flush of youth, this dry rosé goes more for mature almond marzipan along with cranberry juice flavors to give some tightness to the texture. Definitely to be drunk now. Screwcap.",14.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"A flat wine, missing the verve and liveliness of Muscadet. It's  soft, with simple apple and grapefruit flavors. The taut finish is the best reminder of the style.",11.00,Loire_Valley,Melon
"In the dusty, stalky style of Cabernet Franc, this is a light, green pepper-flavored wine that shows the freshness of the year but also suffers from the cool vintage conditions. Drink now.",10.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"A ripe, smooth, velvet-textured wine with great red berry fruit flavors aided by soft tannins.",11.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A nice perfume and crisp, well-defined stony and green apple flavors are attributes of this classified Chablis. Medium-weight, it has a good texture and structure. It finishes tight, with classic Chablis citrus and chalk notes. Appealing now, it should be even better in a year or two. Editors' Choice",29.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Very toasty and closed, it was hard now to get beyond this wine's wood veneer. Faint honey and earth flavors accompany a rich mouthfeel, but this wears an almost impenetrable oak shell.",55.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A blend of 90% Grenache and 10% Syrah, all from vines averaging 80 years of age, this is a stupendously concentrated wine that still possesses nuance and complexity. Exotic spices—notably lavender and clove—scent the bouquet, while the huge palate boasts layers of plum fruit and thick, velvety tannins. Drinkable now, but probably at its best after 2012.",40.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Dense and richly fruited on the nose, but not jammy or simple—there's a healthy dose of spice to add nuance to the plum and black-cherry flavors. Ripe tannins impart a creamy texture to the midpalate, while the finish is long and fresh. Nuanced yet powerful; supple yet structured. This is top-notch stuff from a vintage that's looking extremely promising.",23.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Seemingly at its peak of maturity, although it should stay there for several years, this is a masterful Saint-Joseph, showing great complexity (flowers, pepper, smoke, cherries), ripe fruit and satin-textured tannins. Drink now-2012.",95.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Even though this tips the scales at close to 16% alcohol, there's no trace of heat, just an incredible lush, creamy texture and layers of rich raspberry and blackberry fruit. Hints of coffee and cocoa from two years aging in oak impart nuance, but the old-vine fruit comfortably carries the day. Drink now–2015+.",54.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Escaravailles makes two sweet wines, this one from Grenache Noir, as well as a white from Grenache Blanc. While both are impressive, the red is a touch more impressive. Dried black cherries and cinnamon mingle easily in this unctuously textured wine. The tannins give it a richer, more velvety mouthfeel.",44.00,Rhône_Valley,Grenache
"What a pleasant surprise. This largely under-the-radar estate has fashioned a superb 2004 that boasts a lovely nose redolent of blueberries and spice. The prettiness of the bouquet is backed up by a warm, lush mouthfeel and a creamy, satisfying texture. Drink now–2012.",39.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Even if you're not a fan of the superripe 2003 vintage, it's hard to deny how lush and velvety this wine is. Plums, chocolate and spice elements weave seamlessly in and out, finishing long, with soft tannins. Drink now–2012.",33.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Superripe pear aromas are followed by fruit that hints at oxidation, very open and soft with an intriguing saltiness. Only towards the end does the wine show structure, with pineapple and peach flavors. The fruit is intense, but in the end, the wine seems to fall apart.",23.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Red Menetou-Salon, based on Pinot Noir, is a curiosity, particularly in cool years. This wine is typical—quite lean and austere, with light fruit flavors, but dominated by acidity. To be drunk soon.",21.00,Loire_Valley,Pinot_Noir
"With its total dominance by Chenin Blanc, this is a classic Loire wine, fresh and crisp, with great acidity and apple and nut flavors. It is light and easy, with a soft mousse. Imported by Kysela Père et Fils.",18.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"An attractive onion skin-colored wine with flavors of raspberries and a smooth, full mousse. This blend of Cabernet Franc and Grolleau is more than just fruity, with a fine structure and good finishing dryness. Imported by New Castle Imports.",27.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"Made entirely from Pinot Noir from the heartland of Burgundy, this wine has an attractive light-pink color. The taste is very delicate—red currants and crisp raspberries, with just a touch of softness—but leaves a fresh, uplifting taste. Imported by Boisset America.",15.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A simple wine that tastes of black currants, plum stones and throws in very dry tannins. The wood element shows with the smoky, meaty character, but mainly this is about fruit and acidity.",13.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"There's plenty of classic Bordeaux black currant here, freshening up this fruity, fragrantly fresh wine. The tannins are a whisper under all this great fruit.",11.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"There's a great burst of ripe fruitiness with only a hint of dry Bordeaux tannins. There are great peppery red cherry flavors, berry acidity and spice from wood.",15.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"One of two reds from the Chombart family's 209-acre estate. This simpler one emphasizes fresh black currant fruit flavors rather than complexity. There is a good balance between fruit, acidity and some smooth tannins. It's a wine for a good piece of grilled chicken.",13.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A nose of tart strawberry scents, spice and just a slight stemmy note opens this decent value in Pinot Noir. No, it's not the most sophisticated red Burgundy out there, but it shows where it's from. It also shows some complexity, good acids and brisk tannins. Try it with stew or grilled tuna steaks. Editors' Choice.",22.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Solid and lean, this wine shows a bouquet of dried fruits and leaves, dark berries and leather. The mouth is earthy and masculine in a traditional Gevrey manner, with spicy, dark cherry fruit and cocoa notes. It finishes with medium length and even, fairly resolved tannins.",40.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Sweet rosé needs freshness, and this now just has sweetness. That said, there is still some pleasure to be found in the candy drop flavors, the light sweet almonds. It is demanding to be drunk with cake rather than fruits. Screwcap.",14.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"A very pure, almost linear wine with plenty of fresh acidity. There is some structure of young tannins, but the main flavors are the gooseberries, kiwis and very green apples. A fine apéritif wine. Multiple U.S. importers.",20.00,Burgundy,Sparkling_Blend
With crisp apple and green pear flavors this is an attractive apéritif-style wine that could age for a few months in bottle. There is a touch of caramel toastiness that adds complexity to this invigorating wine. Imported by Monsieur Touton Selection Ltd.,15.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"This wine  has great style and elegance, as well as crisp northern fruit. There's just a touch of toastiness, along with flavors of almonds and white fruits. An apéritif-style wine, but could also work with light foods. Multiple U.S. importers.",12.00,Burgundy,Champagne_Blend
"Named after the founder of the Monmousseau fortunes, Justin-Marcel Monmousseau, this may be labeled as nonvintage, but in effect it's from the 2002 vintage. That gives it some good age, shown in the toasty character. But there is also good freshness, ripe apples and cream flavors and crisp acidity. Imported by Langdon Shiverick.",10.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Young and intense on the nose, where dried black-currant aromas pick up hints of chocolate and espresso. This is full-throttle ripe, with lush fruit, great body, soft tannins and good length on the finish. Drinkable now, but should develop more nuance in another 5 years and last at least until 2015.",42.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"There's a bit of barrique showing in this wine, but it's nicely integrated with spice and floral notes. It's also given the wine a plump midpalate that's not overdone. Finishes very elegant and long. Drink now, although it should hold a few years.",43.00,Rhône_Valley,Viognier
"From the place that gave the appellation its name, Guigal's 2003 Saint-Joseph Lieu-Dit Saint-Joseph is an excellent wine. It's dense, rich and chewy—almost fudge-like in weight and intensity, with chocolaty overtones—yet despite that it's also intensely perfumed (think blackberries and peppery spice) and long on the finish. Drink now–2020.",38.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Although Chave's négociant bottling labeled Offerus can be a bit underfruited in some years, in the superripe 2003 vintage that's not an issue. It's rich, full and velvety, with blueberry fruit accented by peppery spice, meaty, black olive notes and a touch of espresso. Delicious now, but should have stuffing to last through 2015.",23.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Inky purple in color, this traditional blend of 60% Grenache, 20% Syrah, 15% Mourvèdre and 5% Cinsault is a big, tannic wine, but the tannins are supple and ripe. Dark fruit--blueberries and plums--seem a bit closed and brooding, but grace notes of violets and smoke add nuance. Give it 3-5 years of cellaring.",26.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Especially floral—something this reviewer is a sucker for—with hints of rose petals gracing ground pepper and blackberries. Tastes almost floral as well, as it seems to float ephemerally on the palate yet shows some creamy weight at the same time. Drink now–2012.",25.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"From a producer better known for Châteauneuf-du-Pape, this has a beautiful bouquet of crushed spices, violets, and black cherries followed by lush, deep flavors of plums, black cherries and peppery spice. It's round and mouthfilling without being overwhelming, and it's framed by soft tannins. Complexity is raised a notch on the finish via the folding in of espresso and black olive notes. Drink now–2010.",23.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"In many ways, this wine reflects the spirit of France's new vignerons. Isabelle and Arnaud Guicharde started the domaine only 18 years ago. The husband and wife team, with no prior winemaking experience, admit that at the beginning, “We made all the mistakes we could.” They've certainly come a long way. This wine is fragrant and spicy, filled with scents of garrigue, baking spices and anise, yet at the same time showing plenty of ripe, mouthfilling fruit. Elegant, complex and a fantastic value.",14.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"In ‘03, I missed the freshness, laments owner Louis Barruol, but even so, this is darn good wine. Chocolate and plum flavors are accented by spice. It's dense and rich, and while one acknowledges a certain lack of acidity, the wine is nevertheless harmonious.",65.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Fully mature and ready to drink now, this is a thrilling Côtes-du-Rhône. Delicate cherry, chocolate and tobacco scents provide a sense of elegance rare in the region, complemented by a velvety mouthfeel and anise and pepper notes on the finish. A knockout, with elegance and style. Tasted twice, with consistent notes.",30.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Stunning wine that's among the standard-bearers of the appellation, seamlessly blending bright raspberry fruit with dried spices into a wonderfully complex whole. Then it pairs the complexity of the bouquet with a creamy, full mouthfeel and a long, satisfying finish. Drink now-2015.",23.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This contains a fairly high proportion (10–15%) of Viognier, but still seems more tightly packed than Faury's 100% Syrah Saint-Joseph. It's riper, with more cherry-berry fruit and less meatiness, but still has great floral aromas and hints of pepper on the finish. Drink now–2015.",47.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"This is one wine I could sit and smell all day, with its incredible black pepper nose and lovely blackberry fruit. May not have quite the richness and density of the 2003 version, but instead displays impeccable balance, freshness and length.",37.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Very ripe; it shows a touch of alcoholic warmth, but it's also richly textured, velvety and supple. Hints of mint and chocolate accent the lush cassis flavors that glide across the palate. A blend of 50% Grenache, 25% Mourvèdre and 25% Syrah.",40.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This stellar 2004 may be even richer than a tank sample of the 2005, with lovely pear and pepper aromas and honeyed flavors married to great minerality and freshness. A blend of 70% Marsanne and 30% Roussanne, with 60% of the total fermented in oak, the rest in stainless steel. Drink now–2012.",29.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"An excellent effort, La Roubine's 2004 Gigondas takes blackberry and pepper notes and combines them in a lovely bouquet that's more than the sum of its parts. There's a lushly textured, creamy mouthfeel that makes for even more hedonistic delight. Like a repeating decimal, it's long on the finish. Drink now–2012, maybe longer.",24.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Full-bodied, with a creamy texture and bright raspberry fruit that help to balance out the considerable tannic heft. Long on the finish, where it picks up lovely spice nuances. Drink 2009–2015.",25.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"From its lovely bouquet of dried flowers and spices to its voluptuous mouthfeel, this knockout has it all. Perfectly ripe (not overripe) black cherries form the foundation, garnished by complex notes of garrigue, and framed by a firm, ageworthy structure. Why pay more for Châteauneuf-du-Pape when you can drink this now and over the next decade?",33.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A stalky, lean wine with austere fruits. The tannins are dry and washed in acidity. It's firm, structured, hinting at some juicy black currants. There's some spice and smokiness from the wood.",19.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Nice tension shows in the floral, peach and stony aromas of this estate wine. It has a lean frame and taut spine, but good fruit, too, with the gentle peachy notes balancing the crisp edge. Closes clean, with citrus and spice. Viré-Clessé is a new appellation replacing the Macon-Villages, -Viré or -Clessé formerly mandated.",14.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Offers a bouquet of pear and anise, plus an earthy floral note. Richer flavors of apple and quince follow, with lime and toast accents. Displays a good acid spine and some class, finishing even and dry. This wine has nice parts.",18.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A crisp nose of stone, lemon and grass opens this clean white made from Burgundy's other legal white grape. It shows nice lemon flavors, a touch of spice and a straightforward finish. Aligoté is drier and leaner than Chardonnay, an alternative white worth a try.",11.00,Burgundy,Aligoté
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Malbec produced only in good vintages, this year's Verdillac is light but charming. It begins with earthy, blackberry and smoke aromas, and while the tannins are pretty fierce, there's some underlying good fruit. The finish is bitter and requires rich foods.",8.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Here's everyday drinking at an okay price. Lemony and grapefruity aromas and flavors, with very high acid that scours the palate. It's rough around the edges, and the tartness lasts through the finish.",7.00,Bordeaux,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Smells earthy and sharp, with a blast of anise and oak. In the mouth, it's tart and rough, with some berry flavors. The finish is tart and scoury.",6.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot
"Light in body and flavor, this southern France everyday wine has slight aromas of berries, and drinks thin, tasting mostly of alcohol and acids. There's not much to recommend, beyond affordability.",6.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Cabernet_Sauvignon
"Made from Cabernet Franc, this is not as good as the Blanc de Blancs version of Trésor (not available in the United States). But it still has a good onion-skin color, a fresh raspberry character, and a good poise and lightness. Imported by Kobrand.",20.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"Founded in 1902, this is the oldest cooperative in Alsace and now one of the largest. It produces big quantities of sparkling wine, this rosé, with its fresh strawberry flavors, being typical. It has attractive acidity, some Pinot Noir tannins and a touch of vanilla. Imported by Kysela Père et Fils.",19.00,Alsace,Sparkling_Blend
"A wine that is packed with delicious, fresh strawberry and red currant flavors. There is some structure, dryness and some tannins, but it's really all about easy fruit flavors. Imported by Ex-Cellars Wine Agencies, Inc.",19.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"A new cuvée from the Tain co-op, a 400-case blend of two plots of 100-year-old vines. It's rich, filled with orange marmalade and honey flavors yet nicely balanced by fresh acidity. Shows hints of fennel and toasty oak on the finish.",44.00,Rhône_Valley,Marsanne
"This is impressively dark in color and appropriately dark and brooding on the nose as well. It's rather full-bodied and weighty because of the low yields and high ripeness of the year, with almost New World intensity of fruit (blueberries) married to Old World structure. Drink now–2015, maybe beyond.",24.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"This wine seems to have evolved quickly, going from dark and sturdily tannic in June to more perfumed and lighter-bodied in August. I'm happy to report that the changes have been largely for the better, although I have mild concerns about the wine's potential longevity. It now has a bouquet of fresh flowers, herbs and flavors to match. Harmoniously blends amounts of florality, meatiness, spice and fruit. Drink now–2010.",22.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Shows the baked quality some of the 2003 wines have, with dried-fruit notes of dates and prunes but also lots of complex leather and spice flavors. Very supple, almost creamy in texture, this is supremely ripe and probably needs to be consumed in the next year or two.",20.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A bit sappy or resinous on the nose, but later that element seems to recede a bit, revealing herbal accents layered over rich black cherry scents. The ripe black cherry flavors are flawless, while the rich, supple mouthfeel displays lovely structure and balance. Ends with a hint of French roast; ready to drink now and over the next several years.",21.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A new discovery for me, this estate is turning out some very good wines from its vineyards in Gigondas and Beaumes-de-Venise. Perhaps its biggest 2004 is this richly warm Gigondas, which is filled with dried fruit and spices. It finishes with supple tannins and layers of spicy intensity.",27.00,,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A big step up from the regular Côtes-du-Rhône bottling, this villages wine is brimming with ripe stone fruits—peaches and cherries—accented by chocolate and spice. Silky tannins ease the flavors effortlessly across the palate, while the finish lingers elegantly. A winner from the co-op at Estézargues.",12.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Lovely stuff, boasting knockout aromas of herbal strawberries layered over ripe stone fruit. Flavors follow suit, carried aboard a lush, creamy mouthfeel. Then it finishes long and supple, gliding easily away on supremely ripe tannins. Drink now–2015.",30.00,Rhône_Valley,Grenache-Syrah
"Floral and meaty, yet also filled with rich cassis fruit. Wonderfully complex, with silky—dare I say Burgundian?—tannins. Great complexity; from 40-year-old vines.",26.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Better known for his Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Domaine Roger Sabon actually owns more acreage on the Lirac side of the river. This cuvée, made from 40-50-year-old vines, is a big, muscular Lirac marked by hints of tree bark and dark, plummy fruit. Powerful and long on the finish; drink from 2008–2015.",20.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"At five years of age, this wine is reaching maturity, revealing a wonderfully creamy, round, mouthfilling texture tinged with masses of dark fruit, coffee and chocolate. Long on the finish, picking up hints of peppery spice.",24.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"True to Colombo's style, this is rather oaky, but with a few years of aging the oak has turned cedary, blending easily with iron and cassis. Long on the finish, with strong cinnamon notes. Drink now-2015.",80.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
,13.00,Rhône_Valley,Rosé
"Starts with luscious hints of oranges and honey, then adds cool mineral notes to give it backbone and structure. Full and slightly viscous on the palate, with honeyed, stony flavors. Drink now–2010, maybe a year or two longer.",36.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"This impressive blend of 80% Grenache and 20% Syrah admirably showcases the attributes of Vacqueyras, featuring bold red-fruit scents accented by clove spice. It's creamy and full-bodied, with raspberry and strawberry fruit buttressed by firm tannins on the finish. Drink now–2012.",15.00,,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Vigneron David Reynaud has only been apart from the co-operative for a couple of years, but this is an impressive effort. On the nose, this wine has it all, from flowers to spice to fruit. Then it backs that complexity up with mouthfilling flavors of tart red berries and finely wrought tannins on the finish. Drink now–2015.",27.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Owned by the Mau family, this estate situated just above the Garonne river south of Bordeaux, is home to an exciting range of red wines. The white is more standard fare, full, soft, with green plum flavors, but given a lift to finish by a touch of wood.",12.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"The white partner in the quartet of Clarendelle wines from the owners of Château Haut-Brion, this is a freshly perfumed wine, with light acidity and some rich, creamy fruit. There's just a touch of almonds and toastiness to add complexity.",22.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Ripe, sweet and easy, with dried fruit flavors, some ripe fruit and light tannins. Perfumed and attractive; there's just a touch of bitterness from the wood.",18.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This sleek, elegant wine opens with a crisp bouquet of limes, nuts and toast. Subtle orange and stony mineral flavors sit atop a taut structure, making this archetypal Puligny. Firm acidity and a long, complex mineral finish make this young thoroughbred a champion. Editors' Choice.",50.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Smooth and supple, this gem has a fully integrated nose that mixes toast, roasted hazelnuts and sweet meringue. The flavors are balanced and concentrated in the back palate and continue to expand beautifully right on through a fine, seamless finish. Elegant and graceful, this is picture perfect for near-term drinking.",59.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Deutz is one of the great names of Champagne, and this vintage Brut from an excellent, ripe year, delivers rich, round, toasty flavors, buoyed by cascading fountains of fine, tiny bubbles. There is a precisely tuned balance to the wine, which shows off its full fruit without sacrificing its typical elegance and crisp authority. A pleasing toastiness, and a faint hint of honey completes the experience.",52.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"The elegant, forward nose of this estate bottling boasts Asian spice, pear and acacia-blossom aromas. It's very structured and tight now on the palate, with ripe earthy fruit, anise and hay notes still coming together. Really kicks into gear on the long, expansive finish, which is at once juicy and minerally. Impressive now and better in two years. Drink 2003–2008.",54.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is ripe, smooth and toasty, with caramel and green fruit flavors. There is some sweetness, coming from the ripeness of the fruit, but the acidity gives the wine a fine balance. Imported by Plume Ridge Negociants.",10.00,Burgundy,Champagne_Blend
"Violets, and pepper, cassis and raspberry make for a lovely and intriguing bouquet, amplified by round, mouthfilling flavors and a velvety mouthfeel. Soft tannins join espresso flavors on the finish. Drink now–2014.",20.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"From a parcel planted in 1905, this is a blend of Grenache (60%) and an unusually high proportion of Mourvèdre (40%). From the start the Mourvèdre is apparent, imparting hints of cola and treebark and dark fruit flavors--even a hint of espresso. yet there's also peppery spice from the Grenache, and the wine avoids any sense of heaviness or rusticity. The tannins are supple and velvety, the finish long. Drink now-2014.",27.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Mature, but in no danger of senility, Guigal's 2003 Gigondas is a full-bodied, creamy-textured wine that reflects the ripeness of the vintage. Garrigue and leather notes accent black cherries, while the long, spicy finish adds hints of coffee and caramel. Drink now–2010.",25.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A bit advanced—likely because of the challenging vintage—but this is a nice rendition of white Hermitage from the fruitier eastern side of the hill. Marmalade and honey give it weight and roundness, while the prominent spice notes range from fennel to black pepper. Drink now.",111.00,Rhône_Valley,
"A wonderful mélange of honey, orange, apricot and spice; there's a lot of complexity to this wine, all carried by a plump, mouthcoating texture and ample freshness. Delicious now, so why hold it any longer?",42.00,Rhône_Valley,Viognier
"Yves Cuilleron's style is not aimed at blockbuster levels of extract. The 2004 L'Amarybelle exemplifies his balanced approach, yielding ample blackberries and spice couched in a medium-weight wine that is very supple, elegant and persistent. Drink now–2012.",40.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Barrel-fermented, and it shows in the richly toasty and honeyed aromas and creamy texture. It's a round, mouthfilling wine, yet doesn't seem fat or overdone in any way, weaving melon, honey and spice flavors in an ample web of flavor. Long on the finish. Drink now.",65.00,Rhône_Valley,Viognier
"A blend of 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah, this is a surprisingly light-bodied wine for the vintage, yet wonderfully perfumed and floral on the nose. Ripe cherry and spice flavors aren't weighty in the mouth but instead are complex and supple—dare I say Burgundian? Hints of chocolate on the finish add an extra element of complexity. Mature; drink now.",20.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A 50-50 blend of Marsanne and Roussanne, which gives this wine wonderful freshness and vivacity combined with layers of honeyed ripeness. Honey and orange marmalade star on the nose, along with the merest hint of hazelnuts, while the palate features strong mineral and spice notes. Drink now–2008.",40.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"An excellent effort from young Emmanuel Darnaud, offering good richness and texture to go with pepper-laden cherry aromas. It's plump and mouthfilling—especially for a 2004—with silky tannins on the lingering finish. Drink now–2015.",25.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Despite the slightly dark rosé color, this is a more mineral rendition of Tavel, with crushed stone and lime aromas. Yet it's also nicely rounded in the midpalate and long on the finish. The Tavel co-op wines showed consistently well in my tasting of the 2005s.",14.00,Rhône_Valley,Rosé
"Yes, it's pricey for a Côtes-d-Rhône, but it's also excellent, and worth cellaring for a year or two prior to consumption. Beefy, leathery scents add hints of clove and cinnamon, while the flavors include plenty of black cherry and plum fruit. Young and tannic right now, but the potential is obvious on the wine's long, fruit-driven and spice-accented finish.",27.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A lean, somewhat austerely tannic wine, with dry tannins. The fruit is subdued, and there are hints of stalky black currant, disappointing from such a famous name. It could work with steak, when the acidity will cut through the meat.",9.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The younger brother of Château Lestrille Capmartin, this is a lightweight, with good red fruit flavors. Tannins are soft, ripe and sweet with some smooth fruitcake flavors from this Merlot-dominated wine. It's an easy mouthful, ready to drink now.",10.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Has round, complete, aged Champagne aromas of warm biscuit, nutty-smoky notes, and rich, spicy toast. Complex and delicious, it's dry, with a smooth texture and a finish that is long and spicy. A first-rate vintage bubbly.",43.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Peach, orange and spice aromas and flavors, a buttery, full mouthfeel and nicely utilized oak all combine to create a harmonious impression. Ripe apple and butterscotch flavors show good weight. The long toasty finish maintains harmony and balance all the way.",50.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A great summer rosé, which is packed with red fruits, raspberries and freshness. The fruit is ripe, but not too full-bodied, showing some nutty flavors along with the toast and finishing with fine, clean acidity. Imported by Paterno Wines International.",21.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"Moody, complex and brooding, this is a superb wine and an exceptional value. Purple violets, black forest cake, cocoa nibs and espresso granules all abound on the nose, backed by dark juicy black raspberries. Full and firmly structured in the mouth with notes of pepper, tea, smoked meat and black fruit on the palate.",28.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
"Chapoutier's Les Meysonniers excels in 2005, bursting with floral-spicy nuances reminiscent of nasturtium and crunchy minerals. Still, it's soft and mouthfilling on the palate. Melon and edible flower flavors give way to spice and mineral on the long finish. Drink now, although adventurous consumers may want to stash a few bottles away.",31.00,Rhône_Valley,Marsanne
"Toasty and nutty on the nose, this is a lush, fruit-filled Burgundy that nevertheless retains a sense of minerality amid its baked-apple flavors. It's plump and custardy in texture, with ample power and concentration, turning minerally on the finish.",70.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Don't tell the appellation contrôlée police, but this is 100% Viognier (not technically permitted under the Côtes-du-Rhône Villages AC), harvested late with ridiculously low yields, then barrel-fermented and -aged. The result is like liquified buttered nuts, honey and dried apricots. Or maybe it's melted orange marmalade, without the sugar. Only made in occasional vintages, this is a treat.",62.00,Rhône_Valley,Viognier
"Shows beautiful spice hints of anise and clove on the nose, along with a floral hint that adds to the ripe black-cherry flavors. Supple and round in the mouth, this is ready to drink now but should easily hold 3–5 years.",22.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"From a consistently excellent producer, this is excellent juice. It's not obvious, but instead is lush, richly fruited and velvety in texture, with plum and blackberry fruit. There is also a complex interplay of spices on the finish. Drink now–2014.",28.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A somewhat lighter style of Lirac this year, with mixed fruit flavors and delicate spice notes. This is delicate and silky in the mouth, with carefully judged tannins and an almost Burgundian feel. Attractive for its tenderness coupled with freshness and nuance. Drink now. Tasted twice, with consistent notes.",18.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Jean Pierre and Martine Meffre are vignerons in Gigondas who trace their domaine's roots back to 1709, but make this great bargain from 50-year-old vines just outside the Gigondas appellation. The 2004 Saint- Gayan boasts scents of anise, black cherry and flowers on the nose, then follows that up with a lushly textured palate. Flavors of black cherries and spice add some meatier notes, then finish long and softly tannic. Drink now–2012.",12.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Lots of spice—particularly anise, but also clove and cinnamon—with wonderfully supple tannins to carry the flavors through a long finish. Ready to drink now.",17.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Very vanilla-y, but there's also plenty of underlying material. The lavish oak frames meaty, cassis aromas and flavors. Substantial tannins—almost chewy—but lush; drink 2010-2020.",69.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Rich blackberry aromas and flavors are marked by hints of vanilla and toast. It's supple for Cornas, yet still features a chewiness to its tannins that suggest a few years of aging would by helpful. Drink 2009–2015.",38.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Rather rich and intense for a Saint-Péray, marrying honeyed orange flavors with dry, minerally notes. Nice perfume, nice mouthfeel, nice flavors—the complete package. Drink now.",20.00,Rhône_Valley,
"Cool and minerally on the nose, but this is a rich, weighty Tavel, almost like a red wine, with some chewy tannins and firm grip. Modest cherry-berry flavors give enough flesh to hang on to, but this is a structural and textural wine first; fruit is a secondary element.",18.00,Rhône_Valley,Rosé
"This is darker and richer than the domaine's Les Terres Jaunes bottling, but also less precisely perfumed. Creamy black cherry fruit washes across the palate in waves carried by supple tannins. It may lack a little nuance--although that may emerge with another year or two in the cellar--but it's full, rich and satisfying.",17.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Solid, wood-flavored tannins give this wine a good, smooth texture. Flavors of red cherries dominate what is an attractively fruity wine.",10.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A young, very fruity wine produced by Christian Moueix. It is structured, firm and juicy, layered with dry tannins, probably needing 6–12 months of aging. A touch of pepper, red currants, toast and acidity complete this good, very Bordeaux, wine.",11.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This lovely tete de cuvée shows off a mature, sweet bready nose with light citrus accents. It hits the palate with assertive, full green apple, bright citrus fruit complemented by strong leesy notes. Quite young and lively despite its age, it closes long with complex lemon and yeast flavors, and should even improve with a few more years in the bottle.",80.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"The principal difference between Blanquette and Cremant de Limoux is in the proportion of Mauzac which has to be in the blend—more for the Blanquette. Which is why this wine has 90% Mauzac, more spice than fruit, and finishes with flavors of grilled almonds.",15.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Sparkling_Blend
"Red fruit and apricot aromas show this fresh, crisp wine off to advantage. Made from a blend of Chard and Pinot Noir, it has ripeness along with a dry, lingering aftertaste. Imported by Cannon Wines Limited.",17.00,Burgundy,Champagne_Blend
"Deep and peppery, with mixed blackberry and blueberry fruit. Nicely concentrated and not overdone, with a mouthwatering juiciness to the finish and smooth, polished tannins. Drink now–2015.",55.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"A controversial wine I'm sure, as I couldn't even make my mind up about it. Tasted from three separate bottles, on one occasion it was positively stunning and would have rated 94 points—it was filled with explosive stone fruit notes, ranging from peach and apricot to plum and cherry; lush but not unstructured. Unfortunately, the two other bottles showed some volatility and more subdued fruit, so I've tempered my rating to reflect that.",,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A Marsanne- and Roussanne-dominated blend, this is ripe and honeyed—almost to the point of raising questions about its residual sugar levels. But coproprietor François Alary says it's only 3g/L. Tastes like a mostly dry rendition of superripe oranges drizzled with honey, balanced by decent acidity and a sense of minerality. Spicy on the finish.",17.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"A pure Syrah cuvée (not allowed under the appellation contrôlée…it must only be around 99.99% Syrah), this is a supple, ripe Syrah that still retains some peppery spice on the finish. Although the dominant fruit note is blueberry and this wine is a bit Shiraz-like, it's also savory and complex. Drink now–2012.",40.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Lacks the haunting fragrance of the best Hermitage wines, but shows plenty of concentrated dark fruit and toasty oak. Supple and vanilla-laden at first, it firms up and shows more plum fruit and pepper on the finish.",85.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Still youthfully purple in color, possibly in part because of the elevated proportion of Syrah in the blend (50%). Deeply fruited and complex, mixing raspberry flavors with notes of coffee, tobacco and spice. Drink now-2012.",22.00,Rhône_Valley,Grenache-Syrah
"A blend of roughly 80% Grenache and 20% Syrah, this bottling from Perrin & Fils is dense and firm, with enough structure to suggest aging through 2010 at least. Yet it's also wonderfully perfumed, featuring floral and spice notes as well as dark berries that are almost liqueur-like in their intensity.",22.00,Rhône_Valley,Grenache-Syrah
"A fine example of Jaboulet's Thalabert, the 2003 features plenty of ripeness without becoming jammy or overdone. It's round and mouthfilling, with supple tannins and a creamy texture, while the flavors are herbal and peppery but also meaty and dark, featuring notes of black olive and espresso. Drink now–2015.",33.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"An impressively full-bodied and structured rosé, this blend of Grenache, Syrah and Cinsault boasts bushels of cherry and berry fruit as well. Intensely flavored, with a burst of citrusy fruit and supple tannins on the finish. Tasted twice, with consistent notes.",20.00,Rhône_Valley,Rosé
"The high quality of simple, introductory wines like this cuvée is a great sign for the bigger 2005s yet to come. The aromas are intense without being jammy or overripe, featuring peppery, herbal notes to go along with bold raspberry and cassis fruit. The tannins are supple enough to make this approachable right away. Drink now, and plan to stock up on Robin's 2005 Cuvée Alberic Bouvet when it's released.",28.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"From 70-year-old vines, a majority of which (60%) are Syrah (the rest Grenache). Blueberries speak of Syrah, while the creamy mouthfeel and supple tannins speak of complete ripeness. Ends with some peppery spice, enough to impart additional interest and complexity. A nice, easy-to-drink Rhône red.",17.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Shows Chapoutier's trademark attention to mouthfeel in its creamy, supple texture and moutfilling weight; a real deligt. Aromas and flavors run toward red fruit, with raspberries marked by hints off peppery spice.",43.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Unusual for the region in that it's mostly Roussanne. The result is slightly more floral and expressive than most Saint-Joseph blancs, with pear and spice notes delivered in a plump, full-bodied format. Picks up hints of oak on the finish, but this isn't an oaky wine at all. Drink now–2010.",28.00,Rhône_Valley,Roussanne
"Just behind the excellent quality of the 2003, Montirius has nevertheless turned in yet another strong effort for its top cuvée. Ripe raspberry fruit turns creamy on the palate, ending with a sense of lushness and a hint of coffee.",22.00,Rhône_Valley,Grenache-Syrah
"Complex from the start, marrying floral aromas with hints of stemminess, herbs and spice, all supported by lush black-cherry fruit. Picks up notes of black tea on the finish, so while this tastes good now, it may even improve in another year or two.",36.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Another promising 2005. This has a beautiful forward bouquet of flowers and red berries, a supple, creamy texture and satisfying raspberry and chocolate flavors. Long and ripe on the finish.",23.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Vanilla aromas and fresh red currant fruit flavors give this wine a freshness as well as a simple, easy structure. The acidity could be less dominant.",10.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Soft and juicy, but with a layer of minerality. High acidity marks the red fruits and the open tannins of this bright wine.",17.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"Very good depth and intensity of fruit show in this rich and masculine bottling. A ripe black cherry foundation bears cocoa, herb, earth and tobacco accents, yielding a complex range of aromas and flavors. The finish is taut and quite dry, dressed up with tart cherries and leather. Hold for 2–3 years.",42.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This angular, lean but quite attractive champagne displays tangerine, lemon and peach aromas with herb accents. It turns fuller and more spicy on the palate, with an intriguing anise note. It has an even mouthfeel and good bead and finishes crisp and dry.",30.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A pretty, salmon-colored wine, it starts off with scents of strawberry, hay and earth, with just a whiff of cinnamon spice as well. There's a good focus to the mid-palate, with rich cherry flavors mingled with tobacco (!) and spice. Surprising length and concentration follow through into an unmistakable cherry tobacco flavor in the finish. Distinctive and good.",35.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"The pale pink color of this wine is instantly appealing, conjuring up lazy summer days. Made from Pinot Noir, the wine has a smooth, ripe strawberry taste, with just a touch of smoky tannin. Crisp and acidic on the finish. Imported by W.J. Deutsch & Sons.",18.00,Alsace,Pinot_Noir
"A deli cious apple and cream-flavored fresh wine with good acidity. Has touches of nuttiness and kiwi fruits, and a fresh, easy finish. Imported by Vineyard Research.",19.00,Burgundy,Sparkling_Blend
"An absolute gem from respected Languedoc produer Gérard Bertrand. The aromas draw you in immediately with intense, brooding notes of coffee, black fruit preserves, cocoa and tea leaves. The mouth, like crushed velvet, offers more black plum and blueberry preserve notes while dusty tannins dance in your mouth. Garrigue spice lingers in the finish. Hold until 2010–2013.",69.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Shows much more depth and complexity than the '05. A solid core of black plum and berry character are elevated by nuances of menthol, cured meat and dried purple flowers. The texture is like crushed velvet; ripe, dusty tannins and flavors of coffee, cocoa and tobacco linger on the finish.",35.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"From the tiny appellation at the foothills of the Carroux mountains, this opulent wine offers floral aromas—iris, chamomile flowers—alongside black fruit and subtle wood. Raspberry, kirsch, and cocoa dustings flesh out the palate, leading in to a wonderfully long and evolving finish.",28.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A strawberry-flavored wine, fruity and with a touch of sweetness, typical of the Bordeaux rosé style. This is an already mature wine, with flavors of loganberry and only hints of fresh acidity.",,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A full masculine nose of lime and hazelnut opens this solid offering. Restrained orange, peach and toasty oak flavors are displayed elegantly on the full, richly textured palate. Feels mature and ready to drink. Finishes with mineral, peach and oak notes.",39.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is a pretty, rose-colored wine, with an earthy scent of barnyard and light cherry fruit. The flavors emphasize the tartness of cherries with a fair bit of earthiness in the finish. This is good, plain, quaffable rosé, but tart and one-dimensional.",34.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Devaux makes a yeasty, bubbly, straight-ahead style of Champagne. It's tart and tastes mostly of green apples, with just a faint hint of toast in the finish. There's nothing particularly distinctive here, but it is well-made, refreshing and crisp through a clean finish.",35.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"The well-defined bright lime and mineral aromas and light peach-pear flavors ride a fine acid backbone. Despite the crispness and mineral notes characteristic of this appellation, the mouthfeel is fairly full. Very approachable, with a clean, fresh finish. Tailor-made for shellfish and salads. Drink now–2003.",17.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A pleasant, easy Crémant, Adam has produced a balanced, fruity wine, with crisp acidity. Made from Pinot Blanc, there is some weight to the wine, but its main impression is of lightness and softness. Imported by Chapin Cellars.",20.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"This blend of Pinot Noir and Gamay is a fresh, crisp wine, with good rich currant fruits. There is a taut green layer that goes right through the wine, finishing with a lift of softness.",15.00,Burgundy,Sparkling_Blend
"A fresh, crisp wine, with refreshing citrus flavors and a touch of minerality. Has great delicacy and poise. A blend of Pinot Blanc and Pinot Noir. Imported by W.J. Deutsch & Sons.",18.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc-Pinot_Noir
"A hard, very firm, lean wine, showing structure and tannins but little in the way of substance. Old-style winemaking produces an old style wine.",19.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This introduction to white Burgundy derives from sources in Puligny and Meursault. A bouquet of hay, earth, liqueur and even some green tobacco aromas opens to a palate of ripe pear and mineral flavors. Evenly textured, the wine is round but not fat. Finishes crisp and dry, with decent length. Drink now.",15.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"As fresh as they come, with bright strawberry flavors touched by caramel and red currant acidity. For drinking this summer.",13.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"A tense, herbal wine, packed with green fruit, as crisp as a green apple skin and deliciously fresh.",15.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A comparatively serious Villages, its tannins firmly in evidence. There is a touch of woodiness as well. Only gradually does the red fruit come through. The aftertaste has fruity and acidity, but still those tannins.",11.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"A somewhat austere, lean wine, with dry tannins and tobacco aromas. The berry fruits are full of spice and fresh currants, giving a wine that is stalky, firm and finishes dry.",18.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"A soft, strawberry-flavored wine with an attractive salmon-pink color. The wine is fresh, clean and easy with a light vanilla character to add complexity. The aftertaste is crisp and lively.",20.00,Burgundy,Sparkling_Blend
"A beautiful opaque garnet color, you know this wine is going to be intense at first glance. Dark rich fruits abound on the nose and palate: blueberry, black plum, violet, coffee granules and a hint of cured meat. The mouth is silky and full and beautifully supported by soft, dusty tannins. Closes on a long, hearty finish.",56.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Grenache
"With only 75 cases imported, be sure to grab up this wine while you can. It's dark, deep and meaty with strong blackberry, black raspberry, plum, licorice, cured meat and spice flavors fleshing out the rich mouthfeel. Delicious spice and mocha appear on the long finish. Balanced acidity, tannins and alcohol ensure this is a wine that will last for years to come, but is certainly able to drink now.",55.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A superb wine, fresh and ripe, with a characteristic edge of caramel, opulence and bone-dry acidity. This comes from a great vineyard in a great Loire year, so it's no surprise that, like many great Loire Chenin Blanc, it promises lengthy aging—15–20 years if you can wait. In the meantime, now it has youthful vigor and freshness. Screwcap. Available in the U.S. from January 2008.",39.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Clos de Sainte-Catherine is at the summit of the sweet wines of Coteaux du Layon. This comes from a great year for sweet wines, and that shows in the impressive balance between intense sweetness and acidity. It's smooth and crisp at the same time, a great combination. Age for 10 years and more. Screwcap.",50.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"From arguably the finest sweet wine vineyard in the Loire, here is a wine that is deceptively fresh on first taste. Then the huge richness kicks in, balanced with blood oranges, white fig and pear flavors, and a mineral character. Complex, this needs many years to develop; superb.",72.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"An attractive, fresh wine, with apple flavors, balancing acidity and a touch of softness to finish. This is just the thing for the summer.",13.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"A soft, almond-flavored wine packed with sweet straw-berries. There is good acidity balanced by some caramel and softness, which make this a good bet as an apéritif wine. Imported by Vigneron Imports.",18.00,Alsace,Pinot_Noir
"This is a wine from the Alpine Savoy region of France, where the mountain climate is tempered by Lake Geneva and Lake Bourget. Made from the local Jacquére grape, the wine has a mountain freshness, very crisp with grapefruit acidity and a lively mousse.",11.00,France_Other,Sparkling_Blend
"Robust and deep with dark berry, bay leaves and menthol on the nose followed by notes of juicy black plum, mashed blueberry and spice on the palate. Silky texture with a nice, toasty mocha finish.",32.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Peacock (paon) cuvée is a deliciously showy wine, powered with intense sweetness, almost syrup. The counterbalance to all this sweetness is the pear, apricot and citrus elements, which go with the dry layer of botrytis to leave a wine that it has a crisp, fresh aftertaste. Screwcap.",45.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
Luscious and balanced; a superb dessert wine. Brings in the ripeness and richness of great sweet Chenin wines with the grape's ability to save its enormous reserves of acidity. A wine that will age.,41.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
,32.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Made from 80% Pinot Noir, this simple, fresh rosé has good raspberry aromas and tastes. It is a fruit salad of flavors, red fruits, peaches and acidity all combining well. A good summer apéritif.",11.00,France_Other,Sparkling_Blend
"This is classic Chenin Blanc, with flavors of almonds and layers of acidity. It needs some bottle age—maybe 2–3 years.",12.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"A soft wine, full of cherry preserve flavors, along with a bright, fresh waft of acidity. It is just spoilt by the banana flavor from the vinification.",11.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"A refined and complex Syrah from the “Grand Cru” of Minervois la Liviniere. Raspberry, blueberry, rosemary and thin mint flesh out the velvety texture, supported by a solid backbone of gripping tannins and balanced acidity. Coffee and cocoa notes develop on the lush, lingering finish.",46.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
"The Quarts de Chaume, the four fingers of land that rise above the Layon Valley, are one of the pinnacles of sweet wines in the Loire. Showing botrytis and layers of dryness over the honey and peach jelly flavors, but also has great freshness. The aftertaste just lasts.",152.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"There have been 19 generations of Mellots, all called Alphonse, in charge of the family estate in Sancerre. This wine celebrates that fact in dense fruits and dry tannins, a wine that has weight, and certainly needs to age. At this stage, the wood is showing dominance, but there's plenty of fruit here.",130.00,Loire_Valley,Pinot_Noir
"Grown on clay soils, this Pinot-Noir based wine has weight and power. Shows some velvet ripeness, but also boasts dense tannins and black plum flavors. Balanced wood is a fine and firm counterweight to the opulent fruit.",100.00,Loire_Valley,Pinot_Noir
"Intensely mineral, this is the finest of Jo Pithon's range of single-vineyard dry Anjou wines. It is packed with powerful green fruits lending acidity; there is a touch of wood, but this is more about fruit. To finish, there is ripe, but very dry, structure.",27.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"A ripe, fresh, appley wine, with attractive grapefruit accents. It is soft and crisp, with just a touch of softness to finish. Simple and great for as apéritif wine.",15.00,Burgundy,Champagne_Blend
"With its lightly toasty character and a touch of sweetness, this is an easy, party style of wine. Made from a whole clutch of grapes (including Ugni Blanc, Folle Blanche, Colombard), it is a classic blended wine. The aftertaste is soft with sweet apple flavors.",8.00,France_Other,Sparkling_Blend
"A fresh, pleasantly crisp wine that has some structure and citrus flavors. The Chardonnay in the blend gives some roundness, but there is too high a level of acidity to finish.",17.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc-Chardonnay
"A 100% Chenin Blanc based wine which keeps all the freshness of the citrus fruit flavors, attractive acidity, a light touch of softness to finish. A great value for a summer party.",12.00,France_Other,Chenin_Blanc
"An attractively fresh wine, with white flower aromas, packed with delicate acidity and white fruits. Crisp fruits hide a touch of softness that allows the wine to finish balanced and light.",14.00,France_Other,Champagne_Blend
"A beautiful, ready-to-drink red with aromas and flavors of ripe strawberries, raspberries and rosemary backed by violet accents. A moderate, velvety mouthfeel with ample but well balanced tannins and a lengthy finish tinged with cocoa.",22.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A great wine that's sure to please. Ripe and fruity with cherry, red raspberry, thyme and eucalyptus on the nose. The mouth has a solid structure and is well integrated with prominent but not overpowering tannins and red plum guts on the palate. The finish is kissed with a hint of mocha.",23.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,
"Aged in wood for 18 months, and made from old vines, this is a rich, botrytised wine, with wild flower honey, perfumed peaches and a deliciously piercing acidity. It needs to age at least 5 years, when the complexity of the fruit will be enhanced by the wood.",45.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"One of a range of three single-vineyard dry wines from Jo Pithon, this is the firmest, needing long aging as the Chenin develops its secondary flavors. For the moment, it's very dry and closed down, with green fruits, but dominated by structure. Wait 5 years.",37.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"One of the major names in Riquewihr, Dopff et Irion has made a fine, fresh, if rather too soft Crémant. It is easy, clean, crisp and fine as an apéritif wine.",22.00,Alsace,Sparkling_Blend
"Crisp grapefruit and kiwi flavors give this wine a green but elegant flavor. It is dry, fresh and lively, finishing with layers of acidity.",11.00,France_Other,Sparkling_Blend
"A simple, crisp apéritif style of wine, with flavors of green apples, plums and a touch of pine nuts. The wine, a blend of Airen and Ugni Blanc, is dry, and fresh.",13.00,France_Other,Sparkling_Blend
"A fresh, simple fruity wine with honey and apple flavors. It's light, easy and crisp to finish. Made from 100% Chardonnay.",12.00,France_Other,Chardonnay
"A blend of Syrah with Grenache and Mourvédre, this is a quite rich and complex Corbières. Aromas of licorice sticks, plum, tobacco and cedar are supported by cherry, spice and pepper in the mouth. Closes with a lingering, woody finish. A lovely choice for any grilled meat dish.",35.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Velvety texture with strong but not overly astringent tannins. A big, intense nose loaded with black raspberries, chocolate pudding and accents of menthol. The mouth offers suggestions of violets and spice along with dark friut, and leads into a lingering finish. A complex and immensely satisfying selection for the price.",19.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Brooding and mysterious, this is a serious wine that deserves a serious steak to go with it. Dark and ripe with dominant notes of black licorice followed by black berries, plum, milk chocolate and thyme. Full and rich in the mouth with a long finish that evolves from fruit to spice and finally ends on a delicious mocha note.",59.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Intensely aromatic and flavorful, this powerful red from the La Clape region of Coteaux du Languedoc is loaded with black plum flesh, ripe blackberries, wild strawberries and hints of iris and white pepper. Lush and creamy in the mouth with beautifully structured tannins and a long fruity finish.",29.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"While Alphonse Mellot's La Demoiselle shows the weight of Pinot Noir, this En Grands Champs, grown on chalk soil, shows purity of fruit. There may be some leanness to it, but that is balanced by the red berry flavor, and the fresh, vital acidity. The wood element shows through, but it's the fruit that dominates.",115.00,Loire_Valley,Pinot_Noir
". From a small south-facing parcel next to the Clos du Papillon vineyard, this is a hugely rich wine, maybe excessively so. It comes from the hot 2003 vintage, and the grapes were obviously superripe. It's round, full-bodied, with ripe quince and white fig flavors. Is there minerality there? It's hard to find, just revel in its opulence. Screwcap.",38.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"A full-bodied wine, very sweet from botrytised grapes selected from old vines. It fills the mouth while keeping its elegance. Preserving the balance is fresh nectarine acidity. Immensely attractive now, this is likely to age well.",38.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"A heavily wooded wine, very juicy with high acidity. At the moment, it is only wood. But given Vacheron's reputation for long-lived reds (20 years or more), this powerful wine could develop slowly and well. Wait for at least 2 years.",55.00,Loire_Valley,Pinot_Noir
"It's pretty rare in France to find a blend of the Spanish grapes Monastrell and Bobal. But they do produce an attractive, fresh, raspberry flavored, freshly pink colored wine. The aftertaste is soft, with some light residual sugar.",13.00,France_Other,Sparkling_Blend
"Clean and soft with some good citrus flavors, this well-known brand is reliable, fresh and fruity. In a light, apéritif style, it finishes crisp, clean and just off dry.",11.00,France_Other,Sparkling_Blend
"A glorious outpouring of beautifully crafted Chardonnay, opulent but tightly mineral. The ripe apple and pear character has a delicate, elegant squeeze of lime, while the whole wine is underpinned by wood. No doubt for long-term aging.",411.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"From arguably the finest white wine vineyard in Burgundy, this is a powerful wine that shows great weight, but balances that with intense, elegant structure, style and freshness. The flavors are endless and complex, richness combining with the lively character of the vintage. Age for many years.",757.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A powerful wine, showing rich, opulent Chardonnay. The spice and acidity crispen the wine, but leave the powerful fruit in all its glory.",260.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"From a parcel within the Chevalier-Montrachet vineyard, this is beautifully balanced, but a wine with considerable potential. It is rich, but thrust through with a sword of steel, giving acidity that offers a succulent counterpoint to the yellow fruits. The wood is becoming well integrated, offering further richness. For long-term aging.",660.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"From the largest of the Chablis Grand Cru, this wine shows a lively fruit character but also a powerful, taut mineral streak that comes through to dominate. There is no doubt this needs aging, with its steely edge and vivid acidity.",110.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"From a parcel that used to belong to the Hospices in Chablis until purchased by the Moreau family. It is a beautifully fashioned wine, its steely character rounded out with delicious ripe fruits, green apples, pear skin and kiwi fruit. Impressive and for aging.",110.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Still very young, this is showing the proper staying power of a powerful wine. The structure is complex and dense, the plum and cranberry fruits are wrapped in tannins and hints of wood. The wine powers through the palate, promising long-term aging. A great success for the vintage.",259.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
Lovely lilac florals on the nose along with ripe raspberry and honeydew. Round palate with flavors of cherry and mango lifted by bright pineapple core acidity. Quite the lengthy finish for a rosé. Delicious; a steal for $10.,10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
"A delicious wine with loads of coconut, blackberries and cocoa butter on the nose with flavors of black cherry and coffee granules in the mouth. Full and lush on the palate with gripping tannins; drink now or hold until 2011.",15.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
Smooth and elegant with the right Chenin minerality and acidity. There are flavors of kiwi and white currants laced through with vanilla and an intensely refreshing acidity.,37.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"A beautifully crisp wine, fresh and leaping with green fruits. This wine is characterized by its steely core and great acidity, with green plum skins and a structure that promises a long, slow development.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Damien Laureau is a new name in Savennières, taking over in 1999 from his uncle. As with all Savennières, this is dry, but the wood aging rounds out the fruit to give a superrich wine. Flavors of mango and pear jam go with the smooth vanilla of the wood. It feels sweet, but tastes dry. The acidity keeps the alcohol at bay.",23.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"A taut, redcurrant flavored wine, with some tannic structure and clean, fresh acidity. It's lively, crisp and clean, leaving a light, delicate aftertaste.",12.00,France_Other,Sparkling_Blend
"Straddling richness and beautiful liveliness, this is going to be an impressive wine. It does need aging. At this stage, the wood is a big element, but then the bright white fruits—pears, white currants along with tangerines—will move center stage. Keep at least six years, almost certainly more.",328.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A ripe, bold and impressive wine, showing yellow peaches and pineapple flavors to go with its tight core of minerality. There is a touch of wood, but the main thrust is for broad fruit, open and welcoming.",80.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A bright, steely wine with great concentration and a tight, mineral character. This is impressive Grand Cru Chablis for the long term, based for the moment on lime, almonds and green plums, but itching to broaden out.",95.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This has good weight, power and rich fruit. The impressive structure is everything here, forming a solid frame on which to build the ripe plum and fruit flavors. Obviously for aging, over the next 5–6 years and more.",,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Big and weighty, the wood very dominant, a wine with considerable potential. It feels important, seriously structured, edging on austere, but promising a much broader character after several years.",170.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Big fruit, big tannins and a delicious raspberry jelly feel are found on this complex wine. The fruit is equal to the dusty tannins, with the acidity—typical of the year—very prominent. The wine has richness though, with a tangible final burst of power.",110.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Still tasting young, with its lemon and lime flavors dominant, this is going to be a serious, mineral-driven wine. It has plenty of fruit, but it is caged in a firm, tight texture of green fruits. Obviously it needs aging.",70.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A firm, tight wine, still young, still not showing all the roundness and weight that is potentially there. This is a wine that needs decanting, offering some good aging potential.",200.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"At this stage, the wine is closed up, the fruit quite tight. But it is extremely rich, the potential from the spice, broad white fruits and intense minerality all promising good aging.",145.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"For a red Sancerre, this is rich, with ripe cherries and black plum skin flavors, reinforced by well-judged wood. The acidity is also well in balance, a layer that lifts the denseness of the fruit and dry tannins.",65.00,Loire_Valley,Pinot_Noir
"A wild blend of six grape varieties grown in the Loire, the Cognac region and south-west France. It hasn't helped to give character to what is a simple, easy wine, with some pleasant pear flavors and a soft aftertaste.",12.00,France_Other,Sparkling_Blend
"A blend of Chardonnay and Chenin Blanc from a Saumur-based producer, this is a soft, fresh, creamy wine with some light, fresh fruit flavors. The mousse is clean, flavored with almonds.",10.00,France_Other,Chenin_Blanc-Chardonnay
"Made by the Eguisheim cooperative, this brut Crémant is soft and creamy, with a mouthfilling mousse. There are flavors of pears and almonds but also a touch of bitterness which spoils the aftertaste.",19.00,Alsace,Sparkling_Blend
"A big, burly Chablis, beautifully ripe, exhibiting powerful fruits overlaying a core of citrus and apple skin texture. The wine is open, rich, with an enticing juicy character, finished with bright, ripe acidity.",75.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Elegance and weight characterize this powerful wine. It has style, moving easily from the perfumed berry fruits to the blacker and dusty tannins, with the concentration of acidity and freshness within the firm texture. For aging.",212.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Still young, of course, but already the wine is showing great fruits, smoothed by wood, offering style and sophistication. As it opens up, the flavors of pears and sweet apples join the toast and the ripeness. This is on the path to greatness; give it 5–6 years and more.",80.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Bouchard owns some fine parcels in Clos de Vougeot and this shows in the dense character of the wine, with its minerality and tight structure. It is dark, brooding almost, very dry, but likely to age well over many years.",206.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Rich, full, powerful Chardonnay, with yellow fruits balanced with lemon, green apple and white currants. The structure, though, pushes the wine into a mineral direction, adding tightness and toast to the ebullient fruit. Age for 4–5 years and more.",106.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A wine in two parts. It opens soft, with attractive green and white fruits. Then a tight, steely grip shows through, offering aging as well as a taut mineral character. Give the wine 4–5 years.",81.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Still young, this powerful wine has intense steely minerality to go with its almost stark green fruits. It has a great texture, edged with acidity, and a light toast character. A wine for aging.",81.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A finely balanced wine, with the acidity a pure streak through the white pear and lime flavors. The wine is rich, the wood so carefully judged with the beautiful fruit.",104.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A full, concentrated wine, impressive for the vintage, offering solid structure, powerful tannins and ripe berry and red stone fruit flavors. It is very direct in style, the complexities slow to show themselves, just a hint as the wine opens up. It needs to age 5–6 years or more.",90.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Sourced from the La Touge vineyard, this is a bright and promising Syrah offering primary aromas of raspberry and strawberry with accents of garrigue herbs and tea leaves. The palate is just as lively, with ample ripe red cherry in the mouth and on the finish. Balanced, well structured, and easy to drink.",27.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
"A creamy, wood-dominated dry wine; the honey and floral flavors of the Chenin are lost at this stage. But there's a good hint of balance, and the spicy wood tastes will tone down in 18 months.",20.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Maybe this lacks the stylistic minerality of Savennières because of the hot vintage, but it replaces that with richness, creamy opulence and developing flavors of vanilla and almonds, leaving the acidity bringing up the final taste. Screwcap.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"The richness of this wine comes through on from the ripe, supersweet fruits. It's beginning to mellow, with honey and sweet nuts showing more than the primary white fruits. The aftertaste gives crispness and a light freshness.",10.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"A soft, creamy wine, with flavors of caramel, vanilla and ripe hedgerow fruits. Wants acidity, finishes too fat.",16.00,Alsace,Pinot_Noir
"Orange pink in color, this is a soft, medium dry wine that has pleasant raspberry flavors. It is fresh, made for those who like their sparkling wines without much acidity.",8.00,France_Other,Sparkling_Blend
"A light, soft style with fresh, sweet apples and a touch of caramel. This is an easy style of wine, finishing off dry.",13.00,France_Other,Sparkling_Blend
"A big, rounded wine that brings in power, concentration and weight. Perhaps too much weight: a huge mouthful of fruit and tannins. It really needs many years to come together with all this punch and rich texture.",214.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"From Bouchard's own vineyards, this is a fine example of what is among the most renowned of Volnay's vineyards. It has much of the generosity of Volnay along with a solid core of structure, bringing plum skins, dry tannins and red berry fruits. Calls for medium-term aging as befits a lighter vintage.",69.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Big and bold, this lives up to the reputation of richer Meursault. Yet crispness, a core of tight structure, toast and fresh fruits are always present. The play between the characters is delicious and likely to allow the wine to age over several years.",110.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Fine ripe fruit shows on this full-flavored wine, but there is as much of the vanilla, toast and spice character as there is of the peach note. The texture, though, is all fruit, tight apple skins with final fresh acidity.",81.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Always right at the top of Faiveley's wines, this is an impressive bottle for 2007. It has weight, a seamless texture that passes from firm tannins to sweet fruit. The acidity, which fits into the arc of the wine, and the tannins promise aging over many years.",180.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Jayer-Gilles has vines on the lower slopes of the Echézeaux vineyard, hence the subtitle of the wine, “du Dessous.” The wine has finesse, but with structure, and is impressively powered with tannins (although with a nagging green bean character as it opens up), spice, a definite amount of toast as well as freshly acid red fruits.",259.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A broad, fat wine, showing soft white fruits and a definite amount of toast. Only towards the end does juicy acidity show through. It feels not yet fully integrated, so hold off a year.",70.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Certainly sweet, but a sweetness held in check by layers of dry botrytis. This is an apéritif wine, its flavors of apricots touched with white figs making it seem fruity rather than unctuous. Screwcap.",26.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"A blend of Chenin Blanc and Cab Franc, this literally bubbles with liveliness and freshness. Rich, but the roundness is held in check by acidity and a touch of tannin. It finishes with elegance and a zest of lemon.",18.00,Loire_Valley,Sparkling_Blend
"Very soft, very ripe, this is a contrast to the greener wines of Sancerre. Sorbe has long been a leading figure in Quincy, and this rounded, almost tropical wine shows, appropriately, quince and white pear flavors.",17.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Solid, foursquare wine, full of structure and fruit, bringing light tannins into play with black plums and sweet acidity. But the wine also has a lightness of touch, offering approachability as well as concentration. Age for 3–4 years.",69.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"The style is full in the mouth, showing vanilla as well as soft peach fruits. Finishing richly, this is not a Grand Cru for aging, but it does wear its ripe fruit easily with a good burst of steely acidity.",70.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"The aromas are earthy, rich in moist soil. The palate is just as rich, a full, opulent wine powered with yellow fruits and a light touch of spice.",110.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Fine ripe fruit here, with soft, sweet berries and surprisingly smooth tannins. The wine is rich, not heavyweight, but glorying in the opulence of Pinot Noir. The finish brings on the tannins again.",149.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A solid wine, showing some generosity and richness, the fruits displaying a fine balance between sweetness, dry tannins and bright acidity. It has some of the sensuous character of good Volnay, opening into ripeness. Worth aging for several years, but already offering considerable pleasure.",89.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Savennières is a new vineyard acquisition for Jo Pithon, with vines planted on 2.5 acres in 2000. It is properly steely, but shows also richness and intense concentration; an impressive start for a vineyard that will be worth watching as the vines age.",35.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"A freshly perfumed wine, with attractive bright cherry flavors that have a lift and crispness to them. The tannins are persistent and dry, layering with the plum skin acidity. This is not a rich wine, but it makes a fascinating alternative to red Burgundy. Would work well with salmon dishes.",40.00,Loire_Valley,Pinot_Noir
"A blend of wines from 4 different vineyards to make a wine that is partly botrytised, but has a fresh character, along with raisin flavors. Crisp acidity partners the apricots. Drink with food or as an apéritif.",31.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Round and full, what this lacks in minerality, it makes up for in richness, its white nectarine and peach flavors and New World fruitiness. For a Pouilly-Fumé it is big, but it's also likely to age quickly.",20.00,,Sauvignon_Blanc
"This is a splendid wine. Yes, it is more powerful than the usual aristocratic Lafites,  but it still manages to retain a special air of great elegance and presence. The fruits are black, the tannins immensely powerful, the flavors are of black figs, dates, cocoa. At the end, there is a vibrant acidity that shows through, which promises a great life for this great wine. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",345.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This may be from the exceptional vintage of 2003, but Château Margaux remains true to form. First and foremost, it is a refined, elegant wine, with complex layers of flavors. But, yes, the hot summer is there the dense, dry tannins, but somehow they seem to float through the wine rather than sitting heavily in the middle. Acidity and freshness come to finish, giving the wine a delicious lift. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",360.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Thought by many tasters to be the wine of the vintage at the time of the 2004 barrel tastings. Has it retained that status? It is certainly a hugely powerful wine, monumental even. It is also finely balanced, with great dark tannins working in partnership with brooding black fruit. The question is whether it is too big, too powerful: only time will tell. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",165.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Somehow Barton has overcome the heat of the 2003 vintage and has come out with a new wine that is rich and elegant. There are generous tannins, ripe black currant fruits, balancing acidity, all in an ensemble that is so much more than the sum of its parts. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",115.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"With its aromas of new wood, spice and black fruits, this promises from the start to be a powerful, polished wine. It is dense, very ripe (from the high percentage of Merlot in the blend), but still packed with tannins. It's a massive wine, bringing together the heat of 2003 with the big tannins of Saint-Estèphe. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",150.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"With its usual high proportion of Merlot, Palmer 2003 was always going to be a generous, very ripe wine. And so it is proving, but what is so satisfying about the wine at this stage is that the great sweet fruit, which comes right out of the glass. Underneath, of course, there are tannins, so this wine could be drunk soon, and then aged for another 15 years. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",120.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Normally one of the most elegant of Pauillacs, the 2003 is big and dense. These dark tannins mask delicious black fruit, flavors of spice and layers of acidity. This is going to develop relatively fast, despite the density of the wine, just because it is so rich. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",142.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This is a great wine. The winemaking team, headed by chateau director John Kolasa, has taken advantage of the heat of 2003 and the fact that Rauzan-Ségla has a great vineyard. They have crafted a densely tannic wine that, at its heart, retains a cool elegance. There is great fruit, blackcurrants, and acidity which adds to the sense of poise with power. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",47.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Considering the reputation of Lynch-Bages as a rich, polished wine, it is not surprising that, in 2003, the team of Jean-Michel Cazes and Daniel Lhose produced a superlatively ripe, opulent wine, one that could almost have come from Napa. But not quite: The fruit is compact and dense, with layers of acidity that speak more of  Bordeaux than California. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",60.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A powerfully velvety wine, which still packs a walloping punch of Saint-Estèphe tannins. The fruit, under these tannins, is pure, ripe, black and generous. But there is the proper dryness that shows how the team at Calon-Sègur managed to tame some of the excesses of the 2003 vintage. This will develop, slowly, into a great wine. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",85.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This wine is dominated by new wood, which goes right through the big, dark fruit flavors and tannins. Very ripe cassis flavors are under this wood, waiting likely for many years before the wood flavors subside. This is very much in the modern, polished style of Mouton today, made even more pronounced by the heat of  the 2003 vintage. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",260.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"One of the nine crus bourgeois exceptionnel, this estate is under the ownership of the Cazes family of Château Lynch-Bages. With the same winemaking team, it's no wonder that Ormes de Pez is up with classed growths in quality. The character of 2003 gives this wine black tarry flavors, but it hasn't spoiled the wine's dry tannins, structure or its long-term potential. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",35.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A tannins-dominated wine, firm and dry. The fruit is relatively subdued, with a juicy character of raspberries, red plum skins and crisp acidity. This is a wine that needs aging to soften those tannins: give it 4–5 years.",145.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Bold brush strokes characterize this wine, the fruit a complex mélange of red berries, acidity and weight. The wine has good density, offering a strawberry jam character to go with the fresh edge. Tannins are enveloped in the fruits, promising medium-term aging.",58.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Enticing aromas of pear juice announce a soft, open-textured wine, with ripe pineapple and kiwi along with a pear skin texture. The wine is ready, its fruit and integrated wood open, soft and welcoming.",130.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Well structured, balanced, giving tannins as well as acidity to balance fruit that moves in the direction of sweet plums, with hints of coffee and vanilla spice. The wine has a texture that promises aging, but also has a delicious juicy character.",55.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Quite floral with aromas of sweet pea, peach, cherry and raspberry with a hint of chalky minerality. Medium-full yet brisk in the mouth with dominating cherry flavors backed by notes of nectarine pit.",16.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé
"Under the ownership of the Gardinier family, this chateau now rivals some of the classed growths, and deserves its crus bourgeois exceptionnel classification. It is certainly full of new wood flavors, but these are not allowed to dominate dense fruit tannins, flavors of black plums and fine layers of acidity. Will certainly age for 10+ years. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",38.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A huge, opulent wine that packs sweet, rich tannins and spicy fruit. In the midst of all this decadence, though, is a kernel of tannic dryness. This estate, long the weakest of the three Lèoville wines, is now back in top form. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",75.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The most beautifully situated chateau, with its great view of the Gironde estuary, Beychevelle is another of those Médoc estates that has found top form after a fallow period in the 1980s and early '90s. The wine's generosity,  sweetness and fruit is balanced with the carefully crafted structure of wood that underpins it all. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",35.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Managed by Jean-Hubert Delon of Léoville Las Cases, this is without equal in the Medoc appellation. It shows breeding, depth of flavor, beautifully crafted tannins and fine, rich fruit without the overripeness so characteristic of 2003. With its structure, acidity and delicious fruit, this will age as well as any wine from a more classy appellation.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The most southern of the crus bourgeois estates in Margaux, the house at Siran is familiar to visitors from its pink exterior. This vintage is powerful, but still manages to exude that Margaux style and poise. There are dense tannins but they don't overwhelm, leaving fine black fruits to balance the dryness.",32.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"One of the stars in the world of the crus bourgeois, categorized as cru bourgeois exceptionnel in 2003, this wine is qualitatively at the level of many classed growths. Its rich fruit is punctuated with toasty new wood flavors, which should soften and balance in the next few years. An impressive wine that shows great power.",33.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Powerfully structured, with great depth and huge, ripe fruit, along with a muscular freshness of both fruit and tannins. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",100.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A dark, dry, brooding wine, which has flavors of blackberries and red plum skins,  which is not at all dominated by wood. This is a classic wine, with Saint-Julien's elegance and 2003's power. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",30.00,,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The Cuvelier family of Léoville-Poyferré owns this property. The wine shows in the dense, ripe fruit, with dusty tannins and concentration. The fruit is generous, but it has good dry tannins to give it shape as well as depth of flavor. A wine to age 10–12 years, but certainly drinkable sooner.",24.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This wine manages to combine some of the delicacy and elegance of Margaux with the richness of 2003. Under the direction of Claire Villars (also of Château Ferrière classed growth), there is a confidence in this estate and its vineyards which lie adjacent to Château Margaux. Great acidity and black fruits finish the ensemble.",17.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"One of Bouchard's signature wines, this is beautifully textured, a series of bright fruits, strawberries and sweet acidity. There are tannins, but this is lighter than in some vintages, a wine for short-term aging.",118.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A wine that starts with ripe citrus flavors, then moves easily into soft richness as the spicy wood and sweet peach flavors come through strongly. The wood is dominant, but not excessive. Full, ripe and still young.",100.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A rich wine that shows the power of Gevrey, even in a lesser vintage. The fruit fills the glass with aromas of red plums, sweet raspberries and cranberry juice. There is spice here along with juicy fresh acidity. It is worth aging 3–4 years, but is delicious now.",50.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Very pure lemon and toast flavors dominate this wine. It has crispness, intense freshness and lively acidity. There is also a sense of richness that is slowly developing and that will broaden the wine over the next several months.",102.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"An already complete wine, the tannins well integrated into the firm black fruits and acidity. It is foursquare but also has a richness that comes from wood as well as lively final freshness.",114.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This white has a touch of everything desirable. The nose is perfectly structured and classic, with bright stone fruits, white flowers and mineral underlined by a hint of ginger. Spices, lemon, peach and pear fruit come through in the mouth,and persist nicely on the long finish. This flavorful wine calls for flavorful food; think ceviche. Drink now or hold five-plus years for more complexity.",48.00,Alsace,Riesling
"With wood and white stone fruit in fine balance, this is a ripe, full wine, the acidity lighting up the ripe flavor. The wine has a broad character, ready for drinking in a year.",145.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"An astoundingly characterful rosé, the Mordorée Tavel has a hugely complex nose of cherry, carnation and strawberry set against a backdrop of herbes de Provence. Intensely flavorful in the mouth, this wine finishes on a long note of lemon zest and white cherries. An excellent foil for roast pork.",24.00,Rhône_Valley,Rosé
"Decadent and rich. Exotic spice, cherry and lemon nuances are encapsulated in folds of sweet caramel that linger on the intense finish. Quite off-dry, ideal with sushi.",35.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"Herbal and spicy with a strong eucalyptus core supported by raspberry preserves and nuances of African violets and vanilla. A supple, full mouth with juicy dark fruit flavors and spice, which transitions nicely to a mocha-infused finish.",21.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Richness combined with minerality. Quince, honey and white pears are the dominant characters in this powerful, round wine; however, with its hot pepper element, this tastes of its alcohol. The acidity is here, but lost in the wood.",30.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Undoubtedly one of the two star properties in Moulis. Its quality is impeccable: a Cabernet-dominated wine, with superrich black currant flavors that retain great structure and aging ability. Enjoy this wine in 5–10 years.",25.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Always one of the star crus bourgeois, Chasse-Spleen has produced a 2003 that manages to combine the rich, ripe fruits of the year with the right tannins and sweetness, along with blackberry fruits. It has the elegance and delicacy of Moulis, as well as some good intensity of flavor. A wine that will certainly age for 10 years or more.",24.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A closed, austere wine; more solid than fruity, showing very firm tannins. There is a pronounced smoky character as well, with cigar box aromas and toasty flavors. What is certain is that this wine—racy and not too heavy—will develop slowly. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",55.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A small proportion of Patrick Bernard's Haut-Médoc estate of Peyrabon is in Pauillac, and he uses the fruit to make a top cuvée. This wine is suitably powered by dark Pauillac tannins, laced with some new wood and black currant fruits. It's powerful and dense, with considerable aging potential.",27.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"One of the great estates of southern Saint-Julien, producing wines whose regularity in succeeding vintages is remarkable. For 2003, Branaire has produced a dark wine, with dry, powerful tannins coming from very ripe fruit. The wood is dry and toasty, leaving a general impression of a wine that will age at a stately pace. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",40.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This Roederer-owned property has produced an impressive wine this vintage. Full, plump and rich, and packed with firm black fruits which are layered with fine, pure acidity. This is a wine that is likely to age, over 5–10 years. Imported by Maisons Marques & Domaines USA.",39.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"There is stunning perfume on this archetypal Pinot Noir. The tannins are soft for a Gevrey, but the red fruits are pure, giving a character that is both firm and sensuous. It is not a wine for long-term aging, but worth keeping for 2–3 years.",105.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"The folks at Ehrhart have coaxed quite a bit of flavor out of the sometimes shy Pinot Gris grape. This wine is a very ripe example, with beguiling tones of ginger, nutmeg and coriander making for a great first act. The concentrated, off-dry palate shows some nice pistachio flavors and winds down into a candied lemon rind note. Drink with rabbit in a mustard sauce.",35.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"Beautifully perfumed wine, with fresh red fruits and some fine tannins. The wood element is perhaps too dominant for the weight of the wine. Hopefully this will subside. Give it 3–4 years.",125.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A wine that is rich, showing firm tannins, but also plenty of dark plum and berry fruits. Spice adds another element, as does a solid core of sweet juiciness. The finish focuses more on dry tannins.",75.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Perfectly round Chardonnay, not an edge or angle in sight. The wine is soft, juicy, broad, but never going over the top, keeping freshness and green fruits in play as a counterweight.",31.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A smooth, easy drinking wine loaded with juicy red berry preserves, plum and bay leaves. Medium weight, ample tannins and moderate acidity followed by a nice, lingering finish.",14.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Robust, full and nicely structured with good acidity and medium tannins, this red offers up loads of jammy raspberry and blueberry with accents of carnation and mocha. Pepper and spice appear on the mouth and follow through the long, evolving finish.",20.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Solid structure with a prominent red fruit core accented by notes of mocha, spice and pepper. The wine is inviting, with soft tannins and prominent acidity followed by a crisp, friuty finish.",16.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend

"This ripe, creamy wine is well-rounded with herbal and apple skin flavors. It's delicious now, and shouldn't age more than a few months.",20.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"This is a solid, powerful wine packed with tannins and heavy black fruits. As so often, Ducru is taking its time, and this wine is still knitting itself together. But in future years, watch for the generosity, the richness as well as the finesse and freshness. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",115.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"In normal vintages it's velvety and rich, but Giscours seems to have gone over the top in 2003. The fruit is certainly there, generally fresh, but there is an underlying sense of over-ripeness,  which needs to be better integrated: Hopefully this will happen as time goes on. For the moment, it's a question mark. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A fine, fruity but structured wine. It brings together many attractive elements of crisp fruits, ripe peaches, toast and a definite tight structure for aging. Keep for 2–3 years.",63.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A lively, fresh wine that gives a steely, mineral edge to the ripe fruits and the crisp acidity. The wine fills the mouth, a bold streak of apple skin structure boosting the fresh fruits.",63.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A strongly tannic wine, founded on red plum skin and cranberry fruits, with a solid, chunky character. It needs to soften, but it will always be a wine on the dry, tannic side.",153.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A successful expression of serious tannins, while balancing them with firm, dark fruits. The dry edge does demand some aging, five years or more, to bring out the weight of this solid wine.",80.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A big wine, with structure and fruit. The mild tannins are a counterpoint to the harmonious red berries, acidity and dense texture. Boasts a delicious, sensuous finale. For medium-term aging.",60.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Soft and smooth, showing mature red berries and a touch of mushroom. Already very ready to drink: light but also with plenty of ripe fruit.",25.00,Loire_Valley,Pinot_Noir
"For the moment, this Chenin is at the young, fresh stage in its evolution. There are green and yellow fruits, a supple structure, and just a touch of vanilla and toast to finish. The acidity is here, so drink this with a great fish dish.",13.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"A medium-sweet wine, with a delicious, sweet, apple flavor, finely balanced with good acidity, and a lifted fresh aftertaste. This makes a great apéritif.",12.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"The other wine of Pouilly-sur-Loire (way behind Pouilly-Fumé in quantity) is this Chasselas grape-based wine, from a much older tradition. This example shows delicious honeysuckle aromas and flavors of honey, flowers and nuts. A rarity, but a style that shouldn't disappear.",27.00,Loire_Valley,Chasselas
"Moderately intense ripe black cherry, raspberry, crushed iris petals and accents of thyme on the nose and palate. Medium weight with ample but not overpowering tannins and a juicy, savory finish. An excellent choice for lamb chops.",20.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
The second wine of Château Margaux is certainly as good as many crus bourgeois. This vintage is ripe and elegant.  For fruit that is so ripe what is fascinating is the way the wine finishes with acidity and a great lift. Delicious in three to five years. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.,65.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Arsac has become the artistic center of the Médoc, rivaling Mouton-Rothschild's museum. Since buying Arsac in 1986, owner Philippe Rauox has achieved a big turnround in quality: this 2003 Cuvée Le Colombier, the top wine from the property, shows great dusty tannins, hearty fruit and considerable richness. Imported by Victoire Imports.",30.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Finally it looks as if Lascombes is back on form. With its huge vineyard, a good selection of the best fruit has been the issue, and this has happened with 2003. It's not a huge wine, but there is smooth, polished fruit, layered with wood and  dusty tannins. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",50.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"With the huge investment of the Edmond de Rothschild family, it is no surprise that this is the most powerful Listrac wine. This is rich, hugely dense, and very ripe. The tannins are more dusty and soft than usual Bordeaux, but that is the year. Vanilla and grilled almonds show through as the wine finishes. A successful wine that should age well. Imported by Monsieur Touton Selection Ltd.",30.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Good, rich, fruited wine,with lively acidity and a pure fresh character. There is some maturity here, a wine with a fine texture, finishing with rich toast.",25.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A wine that shows structure and the flavors of wood aging. The fruit is dense and concentrated, with a foursquare shape, full of berries, acidity and spices. The hard edge of tannins promise aging.",85.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"An opulent style, very Meursault, the weight coming from the wood and the packed white fruit flavors. The wine is smooth, generous, a big ripe mouthful of fruit. The aftertaste shows some wood.",46.00,,Chardonnay
"This relishes the ripe softness of Saint-Aubin, giving a wide-open wine with weight. The contrast is with clean-lined green plums and just some spice.",60.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Shines with elegance and class right from the start of the toasty, yeasty, appley bouquet with vanilla hints. It's a joy to taste, with its full, complex flavors, ripe mouthfeel and long finish. A great example of how far wines designated Kosher have come, and what is possible in this category.",40.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"An elegant grand cru whose tannic structure is just beginning to resolve. Has a nose of berry aromas, earthy accents and even meaty notes. The palate displays developed ripe cassis and earth flavors. Still youthful, it drinks well, but should evolve further over the next few years.",40.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Soft, with fat flavors that fill out in the glass. This has a crisp edge to it, though, hinting at mineral, while keeping the ripe pear flavors. The aftertaste shows some of the characteristic Chenin Blanc nuttiness.",12.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc-Chardonnay
"very fresh, red cherry-flavored wine, more fruit than structure. Some dry tannins show through the fruit on the finish. This is a wine that is about immediate pleasure.",28.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"A good, sturdy wine, fruity with blueberries structured with soft tannins. This has some good ripe fruit and a layer of dryness. To finish, there are dry figs and dark plums.",14.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"Under the management of Jean Merlaut, this estate has lost some of the super-opulence of the wines of the 90s, and gained finesse and elegance. That has stood the 2003 in good stead, emphasizing solidity and dry tannins to balance the wood and cranberry flavors of the fruit. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",60.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The Mau family, who also run négociants Yvon Mau, have poured money into this Médoc chateau, bringing it back to life. It has paid off in this powerful, rich 2003, which packs blackberry flavors alongside new wood, polished tannins and  impressive aging potential. Imported by Victoire Imports.",21.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"For a young wine, this is remarkably balanced. With fine but not powerful tannins and sweet black fruit flavors, it is polished, with vanilla accents and good acidity. It is already well integrated and should develop relatively quickly. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",32.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This Clerc-Milon, under the same winemaking team as Mouton Rothschild, is an attractive wine, not heavy, already quite soft. It seems to have been heavily extracted, in a New World style, with new wood aromas and flavors, losing something of Pauillac, but a winner in that it's immediately attractive. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",55.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Soft and rounded, with pear juice flavors dominant. This characteristic is balanced by a crisp, fresh, dancing style that gives delicious almond and herbal flavors. For drinking now.",31.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Soft and, for the vintage, a generous wine. The acidity is vivid but so are the black cherry and red currant fruits. Tannins are soft, fitting well with the wine. For drinking now or over the next 2–3 years.",59.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Around the base of the hill of Corton Grand Cru, the village vineyards of Aloxe-Corton have produced a rich, soft wine. Sweet strawberry jam flavors, black plum skins and soft tannins give it a generous feel without being powerful. For short-term aging over 2–3 years.",,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A mature, soft wine, with good acidity and a fine, toasty character. It has good bottle age and a creamy, almond-flavored character. A delicious wine, just showing its origin by being richer than many Champagnes.",25.00,Burgundy,Champagne_Blend
"A mineral wine that brings an austere character as well as fresh fruit. Apples, pears and lime zest are all there. Attractive, open and ready to drink.",35.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Going for a mineral character, the wine has freshness and also crisp lime, pineapple and caramel flavors. Light in feel, finely textured, almost steely.",54.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Firm and dark in character, with some dense tannins over the strawberry fruits. The wine is pure in its fruitiness, with a line of acidity that is almost tangy. Alongside this are firm tannins and a smoky aftertaste.",44.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"There's not too much fruit going on here; the aromas and flavors tend more towards caramel, vanilla and cinnamon, with just a faint lemon tone as a backdrop. After a kiss of softness on the palate, this wine finishes with mouthwatering crispness. Though impressive, this wine is a bit disjointed and could use a few years to integrate.",80.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"A delicate onion skin-colored wine, keeping its freshness after 18 months, just touching on toast and caramel, but principally offering bitter cherries and raspberry flavors.",25.00,Loire_Valley,Pinot_Noir
"Château de Montguéret has made a fresh, piercing, crisp Chenin Blanc-based sparkling wine. Just a touch of almond and a backdrop of honey give roundness to this green wine.",15.00,Loire_Valley,White_Blend
"A seriously herbaceous wine. Flavors of asparagus and green peas are here, alongside intense acidity. Maybe it will calm down in a year. At the moment it's New Zealand on the Loire.",30.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"This Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Gamay blend is not for lovers of full-bodied reds, but it does have plenty of lively, fresh bitter cherry and red currant flavors, and a dry, tannic backbone. A great partner with salmon or cold meats.",12.00,Loire_Valley,Red_Blend
"We first tasted this wine back in March 2008, and it seems to have aged quite a bit since then. Stewed strawberry and rhubarb along with sanguine notes on the nose, followed by riper flavors of fig preserves and spice in the mouth and finish. Good acidity and softened tannins make this wine a good choice to drink now.",36.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Starts off with minor notes of green vegetation that then transitions to overripe fruit: prune, dried fig and raisin. Cherry and plum skin appear on the palate, emphasizing the tannic astringency of the wine. A solid wine, but the 2006 seems to be showing far better.",35.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Under the control of the winemaking team of Lafite, this estate is on a roll. This is a beautifully balanced wine, with complexity, richness and cassis, figs and black plums. It is developing relatively quickly, and will be ready to drink in two to three years. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",55.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Cantenac-Brown has been tending to classic Margaux delicacy in recent years, but this 2003 is an exception. It is round and full of ripe blackberry fruits, with good tannins and is likely to develop well. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",27.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This chateau, owned by one of the old Bordeaux families, the Bories, has only recently begun to gain the stature its vineyard, in the south of Pauillac, demands. This '03 is still very tight, packed with dark, tannic fruits, and dominated by a dense layer of wood. The price is still reasonable, which makes this a great wine for drinking after 10 years. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",30.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"There is a good deal of wood here, the wine tasting of toasty wood as much as the fresh white fruits. It is just on the edge of too much wood, but then the crisp acidity and rounded flavors bring the wine back into balance. It really needs aging, 3–4 years.",105.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Light, fresh citrus aromas filled by beautiful spicy wood, with lovely crisp final character. The spice and wood add to the crisp juiciness of the wine.",56.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"With 54% Bourboulenc, 14% Vermentino, 16% Roussanne and 16% Grenache Blanc, here's a gorgeous Languedoc white loaded with complexity and intrigue. Notes of juicy nectarine, pineapple, melon, tangerine and pink florals dominate the nose and mouth. Balanced and creamy with a long, evolving finish that transitions seamlessly between rich, concentrated fruit flavors and brisk, clean citrus acidity.",29.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"Plenty of wood here, but also an attractive stream of red berry fruits, topped with cherries. The acidity gives good freshness, although, being a Pommard, there is a firm core of tannins that finally march with the wood.",110.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
This is an expressive wine and quite powerful for a rosé. There are lovely peach and apple notes upfront while the earthy palate is enlivened by refreshing notes of orange zest. Woodsy notes on the finish suggest this wine is best drunk up before 2011.,22.00,Rhône_Valley,Rosé
"The Domaine Houchart is everything a Provence rosé should be: effusively fresh, vibrantly fruity and dry, dry, dry. With a crisp, mouthwatering palate, it would make a great companion for flavorful fish dishes. Pick this one up to enjoy a bit of the South of France with dinner tonight.",12.00,Provence,Rosé
"An intensely wooded wine that is dominated by dark tannins. The red berry fruit is buried under the dry spice and toast character, although at the end there is a more juicy element.",40.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A solid, chunky wine that expresses the weight of Gevrey. The tannins are firm but already well integrated with the plum skin fruits. Maybe the wood element is too much, but this could soften.",50.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This wine that offers both minerality and a fresh, creamy character. It is light, with citrus and bright pear flavors finishing as fresh and crisp as they come.",30.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This solid Bordeaux achieves a nice balance between ripe fruit and a more austere earthiness. There's a solid core of blackberry flavor and firm, broad tannins that suggest it will develop more depth with near-term cellaring.",27.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A semisweet Vouvray, with its honey flavors still tasting very young. The acidity is all green apple, with freshness coming from the white currant edge. Lacheteau is a négociant, based in the Muscadet region.",10.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Good, spicy Cabernet Franc, loaded with dry plums and stalky fruit flavors. It's soft, with a streak of acidity to give freshness, but mainly juicy and fruity.",11.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"A creamy wine with toast and acidity. There is an element of spice and a freshness that comes from some green fruit flavors. Soft, gentle aftertaste.",25.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"The blend—Chenin Blanc, Chardonnay and Cabernet Franc—is typical of Loire sparkling wines. It gives a full mousse in the mouth, herbal and green pea flavors, and a soft, creamy aftertaste, backed up by acidity.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Sparkling_Blend
"There's no escaping the garrigue in this wine—lavender, thyme, and rosemary all dominate the nose with accents of strawberry, red cherry and chalk. The palate offers more oak-infused notes of vanilla and sweet spice, rounding out the creamy texture and closing on a long and sweet note.",64.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Grenache, this wine shows beautiful components of raspberry preserves, juicy red plum guts, rosemary, licorice and hints of violet. Vibrant and fruity with a lighter weight than its attributes might suggest and a clean, lingering finish.",20.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Notes of the garrigue abound on the nose, along with aromas of licorice, fennel seeds and raspberry. The palate offers more developed fruit flavors of juicy red plum and berries, followed by a lovely cocoa dusted finish.",16.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A full-bodied rosé with ripe aromas of raspberry, strawberry, watermelon and rosemary. While a touch prickly on the palate, the finish is long and lingering, infused with fruit as opposed to just brisk acidity.",,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé
"This chateau has a fine and deserved reputation, as this powerful but elegant 2003 shows. It has all the sophistication of Margaux, along with some lightness that balances the dry tannins. Imported by Vignobles De France.",25.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Brane-Cantenac's natural elegance, at the heart of Margaux, doesn't seem to have survived 2003 as well as some other properties, despite the initial favorable impression at barrel tasting time. That is to say that the fruit is very generous, juicy almost, but its ripeness seems out of proportion to the soft tannins and sweet aftertaste. Other current vintages, particularly 2001 and 2004, have been better. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",34.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Meyney is often the most gentle of the great estates of Saint-Estèphe, and in 2003 this character is most obvious. The wine is full of vitality and ripeness, soft tannins showing the property more than the hot year. The fruit dominates right through the wine, with dryness only appearing in the aftertaste.",25.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The second wine of Château Potensac, and under the same ownership as Château Léoville Las Cases, this is an impressive wine in its own right, packed with very ripe fruit, but still preserving the outline and structure of a solid Médoc. There is a wood element, but it is mainly the luscious black fruit that stands out in this wine. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",30.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A great success for this fifth growth, run by Claire Villars. The 2003 is velvety, rounded, beautifully balanced. It is not a densely powerful wine, showing more elegance and seduction. It is already developing, and should be ready to drink in four or five years, maybe less. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",34.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A ripe, soft, nut- and pear-flavored wine, with fresh acidity. It is smooth, velvet in texture, with some apple juice freshness on the finish.",14.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"An interesting blend of 50% Chardonnay, 40% Roussanne and 10% Sauvignon Blanc, this is a lively and very aromatic white with scents of pretty pink florals like sweet pea and roses, ripe peach, mango and melon. The same carries through to the palate, which shows great roundness in the middle without being too flabby. The finish is clean but lengthy. Delish.",15.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,White_Blend
"A smooth, perfumed wine, with an initial barnyard character that then softens into red fruits and soft tannins. Relatively light, going more for juiciness than weight.",35.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Broad, ripe, full in the mouth, packed with soft white fruits and an open structure. There is some wood, the vanilla melding easily into the fruit. For drinking now.",27.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Bouchard's village wines express the nature of each place well. None more so than this firmly tannic Nuits-Saint-Georges. The tannins are a firm presence, but flavors of spice and bitter cherry fruits and final juicy acidity are there as part of the mix.",55.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A wine that reflects the relative lightness of the reds in this vintage. It has a layer of tannins, but they don't suggest aging; they are more a base for the attractive raspberry and red plum flavor, freshened by the acidity.",50.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"The Domaines Ott Chateau de Selle is a breed apart, with little of the effusive red fruit that we typically associate with Provence Rosés. The 2008 shows vanilla and butterscotch aromas that lead to a serious, medium-weight palate with good flavor intensity. Winds up on a lingering note of newly-mown hay. Drink now.",42.00,Provence,Rosé
"Black fruit backed by notes of tobacco, bacon and barnyard on the nose and palate. The alcohol is present in the mouth, but overall the texture is full and balanced with strong, gripping tannins and a nice, long finish.",23.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A fresh, smoky, lightly-acidic Saumur Champigny, maybe without great depth, but with vibrant red fruits. Enjoy this year.",15.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"This is restrained, with very crisp apple-skin acidity, and a generally light, fresh texture. Certainly a food wine. Screwcap.",10.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"A wine initially dominated by wood, but opens to show ripe, black fruits, flavors of herbs and firm, dry tannins. From an 88-acre vineyard in the west of Listrac, this is a finely structured wine, which will certainly age well. Imported by Heidelberg Distribution.",13.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The muted nose offers faint hay and floral aromas, but this wine opens up in the mouth with bread flavors accented by toast and citrus. The texture is dry and full, and the finish moderately long with attractive grapefruit and mineral flavors.",40.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"The deep color and viscous, almost oily texture attest to the high level of concentration in this wine. Unusually, the nose is more mineral than fruit, while some cinnamon flavors peek through in the mouth. Soft acidity and high residual sugar suggest it should be consumed all by its lovely self.",34.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"A fascinating nose, with grapefruit, kiwi, citrus, orange rind and hay that fold in to a peach/pear structure in the mouth. Very light and almost austere on the finish, this is a Riesling that would be at home at a raw bar. Drink now to 2012.",30.00,Alsace,Riesling
Luscious and weighty with good varietal character. Lychee and spiced pear dominate upfront while the flavorful palate exhibits honey and nutmeg. Notes of baked apple pie hang around for quite a while. The spiciness and slight sweetness call for a Thai curry dish.,30.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"A lively, impressively fresh Aligoté, packed with green and citrus fruits, bubbling with bright vivacity.",20.00,Burgundy,Aligoté
"Tannins and red plums combine in this light, elegant wine. The acidity is important though, with the fruit fresh rather than warm.",47.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Fashioned in the gutsy Ehrhart house style, this example does not disappoint, opening with intense Chinese spice and ground coriander which yield to cut apple and nutmeg flavors on the palate. It's off-dry in the mouth but a hit of acidity on the long lemon-honey finish leaves a refreshing impression. Serve with Malaysian food. Drink now to 2011.",24.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"Showing well with moderate aromas of cherry and apricot supported by subtle floral accents. The palate is light but full with juicy strawberry and tropical citrus notes. Crisp, flavorful, and well balanced.",11.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah-Grenache
"A juicy, easy to drink Minervois with notes of small black berries, baby powder and eucalyptus. Lighter weight and soft tannins makes this wine easy to approach, and an excellent companion for lamb burgers.",13.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Partly owned by New York resident Peter M. F. Sichel, this is a property that has considerably improved. This 2003 has richness, some good new wood flavors and and an open character. The fruit is packed with ripe, black flavors and there is softness to the aftertaste that is immediately appealing. Imported by Parliament Wine Co.",22.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"One of the best vintages for many years from this rather forgotten property. The wine is developing fast, already well integrated, powerful and dense, but dominated by attractive, ripe fruit. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",30.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"From a mosaic of 90 different scattered parcels, oenologue Georges Pauli has constructed a firm style of wine, with Saint-Estèphe's characteristic tannins and fresh black currant fruits. This is a structured wine, which should certainly age well. Imported by Fruit of the Vines, Inc.",17.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A ripe wine, balanced with a crisp edge. The structure is rounded, full of green plums, quince, given liveliness with a lime zest acidity. There is a light wood touch that shows through at the end.",25.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A wine that is all about crispness, structure and bright fruits. The creamy texture from lees aging gives a rounder dimension, but the main thrust here is minerality coupled with delicious acidity.",20.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Caramel wood aromas, with smooth fruit. The wine is rich, warm, with the pure white and yellow fruit flavors showing well. It is crisp, but also rich.",36.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"After a subtle, nutty opening, we get more intensity in the mouth, with honey, clove and graham cracker flavors coming through. The texture here is opulent while the finish offers up forthright notes of caramel, lemon and cut apple that hang around just long enough. Drink or hold one or two years.",28.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"There is plenty of wood here, quite a dominant feature. The fruit comes behind, showing bright ripe white fruits and a hint of apricot. The wood spice, though, has the last word.",55.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Serious mineral tones take precedence over the fruit here, with hay aromas giving way to flavors of stones and just a hint of apricot on the palate. Some strawberry fruit graces the medium finish. This wine is fairly dry, a flexible partner for a variety of classically prepared fish poultry.",32.00,Alsace,Riesling
"A light style of Pinot Noir, with strawberry jam aromas. The delicate fruit is shot through with dry tannins and the aftertaste is definitely on the acidic side.",28.00,Loire_Valley,Pinot_Noir
"An easy, attractive wine that shows some of the very ripe, small berry flavors of 2003. Dense but sweet tannins balance the black fruits and the solid structure which lies underneath this rich wine. One of the three Lurton properties owned by Marie-Laure Lurton.",15.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"With 44% of Cabernet Sauvignon and an equal amount of Merlot, this wine perfectly expresses the relatively cool vineyards of Listrac. It has structure, tautness and fine, violet perfumes and layers of spicy wood. Fine, clean acidity suggests good aging potential. Imported by Carolina Wine Co.",19.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The Le Mas, or “little farm,” is 80% Sauv Blanc with 15% Viognier and 5% Vermentino. There's a nice chalky note to the bouquet along with hints of sweet pea, lavender and stone fruit that continue through to the finish. A different, more nuanced style of Languedoc white.",14.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,White_Blend
"A darkly tannic wine, showing a dry side of Pinot Noir but still offering some good berry fruits and raspberry sweetness. The acidity needs to soften, though.",68.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A blend across the Mercurey appellation, this is a well-structured wine, offering both a solid core of dry tannins and dark plum and fresh juice flavors. The perfumes are very present, exotic, the acidity is in the lively style of the vintage. For drinking now.",30.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Rather fat, this misses the essential freshness of good Muscadet. The flavors are of white pears, a touch of almonds and kiwis; needs more lift.",10.00,Loire_Valley,Melon
"A soft, smooth, apples-and-cream-flavored wine, shot with acidity and some green fruit. It's a light wine, very crisp and clean, better with food than as an apéritif.",10.00,Loire_Valley,Chardonnay
"Despite its provenance from a warm year, this still shows too much stalky character. Wood rounds it, but also dominates. It's dry and firm, with a smoky aftertaste.",15.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"A very herbal rosé with strong notes of bay leaves and yellow flowers, backed by notes of underripe peach, canteloupe and white raspberry. Light and bright in the mouth with a cherry-kissed, clean finish.",16.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé
"A somewhat simple but undoubtedly tasty offering from the Languedoc. Ripe red berries and garrigue notes on the nose and palate, emphasized by lively acidity and a subtle tannic structure. Short finish, but clean and vibrant.",13.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A small, 17-acre property near Saint-Laurent in the north of Medoc, this is a classic Bordeaux, with its tight tannins, layers of dryness and acidity. But these are not negatives because this is a delicious food wine, one that also has great black fruits. Imported by Victoire Imports.",17.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The nose beguiles, with scents of vanilla, freshly baked bread and wet stones that give way to tones of lemon and apricot on the tongue. This wine is light-bodied and crisp, a good summer sipper. Drink up over the next year, perhaps with a piece of grilled fish.",15.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Done in a clean and fresh style, this Pinot Gris has nice depth of flavor, with plenty of apricot and pear interest in the mouth. The fruit here is very healthy and the impression totally dry. Hazelnuts and just a touch of minerality linger on the finish.",27.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"Aromas of yellow flowers and cedar-plank-grilled pears follow through to the palate alongside notes of fresh peach slices and lime. Though quite round in the mouth, the finish is long and evolving, transitioning from ripe fruit to a clean, assertive acidity.",12.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"With 30% Grenache Gris, 40% Bourboulenc and 30% Rolle (or Vermentino), here's a ripe, lush white blend from the South of France. Aromas of peach, roasted red apple, jasmine and a kiss of honey fill the bouquet, while the round, full mouthfeel shows more toasty cedar notes. A big, developed wine that has lots to offer.",20.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"A soft wine that hints at the richness of Meursault, with caramel flavors giving weight, and a distinct citrus and apple character giving freshness. For early drinking.",54.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A weighty wine, with tight tannins on ripe plums, berries and a juicy, earthy flavor. It shows all the proper chunky character of Pommard, solid and foursquare. The relative lightness of the vintage means it will be ready to drink soon.",47.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
Here's an 100% unoaked Chard that offers ripe tropical notes of mango and pineapple alongside flavors of rich red apple and canteloupe in the round mouth. Softly prickling acidity leads nicely into the fruity finish.,12.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"The crispest Aligoté, all grapefruit and bright green fruits. The wine is fresh, clean and lively. There is a final light element of wood.",20.00,Burgundy,Aligoté
"An attractive, fresh Chablis, with flavors of juicy currants, spice and lime juice. It is crisp and shows full final fruit and acidity.",19.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Once the sulfur note blows off this young wine, the tart berry and cherry aromas and flavors wear cocoa and tobacco accents. On the tongue an even palate-feel and smooth texture please, and decent acidity supports the fruit.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot
"So light, dry and taut, you might mistake this for a Sauvignon Blanc with its grapefruit profile and high acidity. Still, the cleansing tartness is likeable, if not entirely expected. This will work as an apéritif or paired with lighter foods.",8.00,Loire_Valley,Chardonnay
"Soft and open, a little unfocused but a pleasantly ripe Chardonnay. The white fruit and acidity are well in balance in a wine that is perfectly ready to drink.",24.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This rosé from the Côtes du Rhône is ahead of the pack, with intense cherry and spice character, a dry, crisp palate and a lovely strawberry finish that hangs around just long enough.",14.00,Rhône_Valley,Rosé
"Here's a great Sauv Blanc sure to please on warm, sunny days. Prominent but not overdone tropical fruit notes play with soft peony and citrus on the nose and mouth. Lighter in weight with great, balanced acidity and a crisp, appropriately tingly finish.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Ripe, creamy wine with a good toast element. It is smooth, elegant, the flavors showing almonds, vanilla, baked apple and pear enlivened by fresh acidity. Attractive, ready to drink.",23.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"With 70% Syrah and 30% Grenache, this wine exhibits loads of red fruit character: raspberries strawberry, red currant and rhubarb all make an appearance backed by accents of garrigue herbaceousness. Good acidity and light tannins makes this an easy go-to for barbecue chicken or pork.",19.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Light brick color with a delicate nose of barely ripe strawberry, thyme, tomato leaf and a tinge of licorice. Lighter weight and delicate tannins match the somewhat thin red fruit flavors in the mouth. A solid drink with nice accents of spice on the finish.",19.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Starts off with a slight medicinal note that blows off after some time in the glass, which then allows the cherry, red berry and menthol notes to shine through. Moderate acidity with soft, approachable tannins makes this a perfect session wine for drinking with friends.",20.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
"Candy and fruit drops are the first impression of this young wine. It has some good fruit, more in the honeyed and nut character, but that heavily perfumed candy character doesn't fit well.",18.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Bright cherry and cedary aromas open to a soft mouthfeel and tart blackberry flavors with black toast shadings. The dark flavors and light mouthfeel are a bit out of sync, as if the flavor range demands more weight on the palate. Tart black fruits show on the finish.",11.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
"There is an edge of minerality, a tight texture. But that lies on a wine that has some weight and richness, white fruits giving a broad swathe of ripeness, just brought into line by the taut acidity.",45.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This value-priced Chard offers a medium-intense bouquet of orange rind, Granny Smith apple and white peach pit followed by a round mouth with accents of apple skins and buttercup. Balanced with a solid finish and low alcohol.",9.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"Soft Chardonnay, nicely balanced between ripe white fruits and some toast. It is an open, generous wine, enjoyable and ready to drink.",18.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Soft, lilting wine that is gentle, ripe and ready to drink. The fruits have some sweetness, the tannins are light, and the acidity is fresh and never too intrusive.",35.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"The Nony-Borie family is one group of families at the heart of the Bordeaux wine trade, and with this chateau they show a belief in the classic characters of Bordeaux. The wine is firm, tannic, with true black currant flavors and some solid layers of wood. A very good benchmark Bordeaux. Imported by Bayfield Importing Ltd.",17.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A good, round wine with moderate flavors of dark plum and berries. Hints of spice appear on the palate. With a medium finish and subtle tannins, this is an easy quaffer good for barbecue fare.",15.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Herb and mineral aromas and flavors prevail in this dry, light-to-medium-weight sparkler. It has decent texture, but the flavors bear a medicinal quality ending with a slight bitterness.",15.00,Alsace,Champagne_Blend
"This is very light, in both flavor and body. The aromas are earthy, with a faint suggestion of blackberries, and the mouthfeel is thin. These aren't terrible flaws, but the wine just lacks substance.",17.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A voluptuous blockbuster in the style we are becoming accustomed to from über-consultant Michel Rolland: big, deeply fruited (black cherries) and plush, with elegantly etched spice shadings from new oak. The tannins are supple but substantial; it should age for a long time. Made entirely from old-vine Malbec and named after the pigeon coop in the Château's courtyard.",60.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"Like a Rubens nude, this wine is fat and round, but somehow quite appealing, with layers of plump, ripe fruit and a luxurious texture. Canned pears dominate the aromas while plum pudding and apple spice cake merge with ginger on the palate. There is unrepentant sweetness here; serve alone or with fruit salad.",40.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"A soft, firm wine with a nice touch of citrus. The character is fresh, light, with a fine burst of final acidity to mark an easy, bright wine.",37.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A somewhat strange nose of overripe mashed red plums and cherries with a strong herbal, piney core. More of the same in the medium weight mouth along with nuances of soft strawberries. Solid finish; drink now.",17.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Dense and rich but also incredibly complex, long and elegant, this is a momumental Côte-Rôtie. It's darkly fruited and superripe, yet doesn't lose its essential sense of terroir, remaining marked by scents of pepper and espresso to go with the chocolate and cassis fruit. Velvety in texture, this is the one of Guigal's 2003 Côte-Rôties that demands a few years of cellaring. Drink 2010–2040.",450.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"This is breathtaking stuff, incredibly complex on the nose, where it features hints of vanilla, clove, cinnamon, cassis, pepper and asphalt. It would be a wine to sit and smell all day if it weren't so delicious to taste. Rich waves of cassis fruit cascade over the palate without losing complexity, buffered by incredibly supple tannins. The virtually endless finish confirms the quality. Drink now–2030+.",450.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Sure, this wine shows the effects of the hot summer in its slightly jammy raspberry flavors, but there's also incredible complexity to complement the fruit intensity—Asian spices, tea, pepper and meat, to name just a few nuances. It's all wrapped in a blanket of soft tannins, but stays fresh-tasting thanks to great minerality despite low acidity. Drink now–2030 or beyond.",96.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Chapoutier's top white in 2004 is this knockout cuvée parcellaire he calls De L'Orée. Aromas of truffles and honey burst from the glass, while the flavors lean toward peaches and toasted nuts. It's full-bodied and undoubtedly high in alcohol, but there's no trace of heat, and while it's broad and mouthfilling because of its size, it still finishes fresh and minerally.",160.00,Rhône_Valley,Marsanne
"Le Méal is said to be the warmest terroir on the Hermitage hill, and thus it is no surprise that this bottling fared the best in the challenging 2004 vintage. Flamboyant, creamy waves of raspberry fruit flood the palate, bringing hints of meat, smoke and pepper along for the ride and developing lovely soft tannins on the caressing finish. Approachable now, but should age well through 2020.",202.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Chave's white Hermitage is even better than his acclaimed red in 2004. It's wonderfully toasty upfront, backed by layer upon layer of honeyed fruit that simply defies description. Yet despite the incredible richness, there's also tremendous focus and minerality, so that the wine never seems overly weighty, and it finishes with great length and intensity. Drink it now, or try it in 15 years; the 1991 is singing now at age 16.",98.00,Rhône_Valley,Marsanne
"How can a wine be this hugely concentrated, yet remain supremely elegant? Espresso, black olive and floral notes zoom from the glass, backed by layers of rich, creamy cherry fruit, making this a complex, complete wine. Tannins are amazingly supple, imparting a velvety feel to the long finish. Drink now–2025 and beyond.",450.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Honeyed and nutty on the nose, this appears at first sniff to be very ripe and rich. And the palate follows through, delivering waves of fabulously rich fruit that miraculously don't seem heavy. A marvel.",145.00,Rhône_Valley,Marsanne
"From 50-year-old vines, this is Sorrel's top cuvée of white Hermitage, laden with scents of truffled honey and almonds. Yet despite that obvious richness on the nose, it's a bit more restrained on the palate than the 2005, with a more powerful structure and marginally less lushness. Not better, not worse, just different: longer on the finish, more tightly constructed and probably longer-lived.",140.00,Rhône_Valley,Marsanne
"One of the group of estates owned by Jean-Michel Lapalu (the others include Liversan), this is a relatively soft wine, but one with good ripe fruits. This means that it is ready to drink now, an easy wine, with pleasant stalky tannins. Imported by Wine Frog.",29.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Mature now, with spice, animal and mineral scents that lead to lime and tar notes in the mouth. Lingering, flavorful finish of cedar. Drink before 2011.",42.00,Provence,Rosé
"Dry and light, this is a decidedly elegant wine. It shows an enchanting mix of peach, peanut brittle and lemon flavors in the mouth that wind up in a lovely but fleeting pineapple note. Drink now to 2011.",27.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"A lovely Sauv Blanc nose with pretty floral notes dancing among aromas and flavors of ripe tropical fruit, peach and tangerine oil. Light weight with good acidity and a clean finish. Fresh and inviting; not terribly complex, but a great example of the varietal.",13.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Soft, rather unfocused wine, its fruit slow to show. There are flavors of apple juice, a tight steely edge, but the wine finishes simply.",26.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Fresh and zesty, with plenty of pretty strawberry fruit to go around and a faint mineral undertone. Medium, raspberry-inflected finish. A great choice for summer sipping.",16.00,Rhône_Valley,Rosé
"A beautifully perfumed aroma leads to a fresh, light but attractive wine. The fruits dominate, with red cherries and plum skins, a touch of jam and a final streak of acidity.",30.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Merlot and 10% Grenache make this a flavorful and well structured Vin de Pays from the south of France. Fleshy in the mouth with ripe tannins, notes of black plum, blackberry, fennel and a hint of green pepper lead into the solid finish.",13.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Fairly intense for a rosé with aromas and flavors of bubble gum, red cherry, banana, and peaches and cream. Medium weight with appropriately prickly acidity and a solid, refreshing finish.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Cinsault
"Wonderfully aromatic and complex, blending floral notes with mineral scents, bold cassis fruit and cracked pepper. This is full-bodied and muscular on the palate, the only one of Chapoutier's 2004s that really demands cellaring. Drink 2010–2020.",250.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"For white Hermitage, this is tight and minerally, with more structure than Chapoutier's other microcuvées and possibly more aging potential. There's a bit of truffle on the nose, but it's not so exotic as the De L'Orée, nor so rich and fat as Le Méal. Finishes with tremendous length and minerality.",260.00,Rhône_Valley,Marsanne
"Delas's cuvée parcellaire is a rich wine that's almost syrupy in its concentration and tannic strength. But this definitely has plenty of fruit for balance, mixing cassis with black olive, espresso, cinnamon and clove. Not quite as rich as the '03, but still a classic, with great persistence on the finish. Best after 2015.",128.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"This was Chapoutier's initial microcuvée of Hermitage, bottled for the first time in 1989. The 2004 version is smoky and gamy, accented by pepper and a hint of rhubarb, but lush red fruit flavors take over on the palate, gliding easily across in a creamy mass that turns chewy on the finish. Drink 2010–2020.",225.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Intoxicatingly fruity and forward on the nose, this wine—a blend of Le Méal and Les Greffieux—follows up with rich layers of black fruit. It may lack a little of the minerality found in other parts of Hermitage, but this is immensely seductive stuff—maybe the Pomerol of Hermitage?",145.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Rich, creamy and lush, this is like no other Clape Cornas before or since. Jammy raspberry fruit coats the palate, yet without seeming simple or heavy because there's also a remarkable sense of minerality and balance. Long on the finish, buffered by soft tannins. As this ages, expect to see some of the jamminess recede and more of the minerality emerge. Drink 2010–2025, possibly longer.",82.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"A top-notch effort from a difficult vintage, Chave's 2004 red Hermitage is a complete wine: complex and balanced. Spice, meat and red fruit aromas and flavors swirl together in a mix of power and elegance. Acids are a touch crisp, but that's the vintage speaking. Drink 2010–2025.",98.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Explosively rich and unctuous, this verges on being fat and overblown, then takes a few mincing steps back from the edge. Grilled apricot and peach flavors coat the palate, coming to a climax on the long, oily, fruit-filled   finish.",165.00,Rhône_Valley,Marsanne
"Named after Alphonse Jr's father (Edmond Alphonse), this is the top wine from the Mellot estate. With its extra bottle age and wood flavors this is not typical Sancerre. But it is a great wine, packed with ripe, mature fruits, with honey and pistachio flavors and a round, smooth, creamy, caramel character.",61.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"This bottling from Guigal's own Hermitage holdings is incredibly rich and ripe (15.5% alcohol). In fact, it comes dangerously close to being overblown before the syrupy cherry fruit is reined back in by underlying spice and minerality. Expect that minerally edge to assert itself more with time in the cellar, making this a wine worth revisiting in 10 years' time.",450.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"This ratchets up the intensity from Voge's other Saint-Pérays, bringing waves of toasty, mealy and citrusy aromas and flavors. It seems almost floral on the nose, yet is authoritatively weighty on the palate. It's powerful, yet crisp, with a long, velvety-textured finish. Delicious now, but should hold well.",52.00,Rhône_Valley,Marsanne
"A soft wine that has easy but attractively ripe fruit. This is not a wine for aging, but in 2003, the estate has made a very drinkable wine. Patache stands for an ancient coaching inn, recollected on the wine's label by a coach and horses. Imported by Grands Chais de France.",24.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A fresh, lightweight Chardonnay, hinting at citrus and almonds. There is a taut, tannic edge to the yellow fruits, the acidity turning to a firm texture. Final acidity is fresh and crisp.",15.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Moderately intense with notes of baked apple, peach, toasted brioche and almond milk on the nose and palate. The alcohol is a touch forward, but it's balanced by the ripe fruit and nutty, roasty flavors. A delicious hint of vanilla appears on the finish. Drink now.",11.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Marsanne-Roussanne
"Here's a rich and smoky Chard with nice aromas and flavors of wood-grilled red apples with a caramel drizzle, peach pit and Key lime citrus. Solidly structured with good heft, a long finish and prominent acidity that keeps the wine from going over the edge and being too flabby. Drink now.",13.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"Light fruit, dwelling on bitter cherry and fresh raspberry flavors. The wine shows crisp acidity, tight tannins and a cool feel.",29.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A perennial value, this year's edition boasts plenty of smoky blackberry aromas tinged with slight game notes. Medium-bodied—verging on full—there's loads of fruit and flavor packed into an easily accessible format. Ready to enjoy now and should continue to drink well for a few more years.",8.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
"A refreshing rosé that's well worth the price. Wild strawberry, bubble gum and cherry are supported by tangerine-tinged acidity. Balanced and refreshing, an excellent summer quaffer.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
"Alphonse Mellot Jr, the 19th generation of Alphonses to make wine at La Moussière, has raised his family's domaine to a new height. This is so evident in this super-rich, concentrated wine, but one that doesn't lose sight of its cool climate, chalk soil origins. So there's great opulence, but also a vivid green acidity that strikes right through the wine.",61.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"The 2004s at Ogier are tremendously successful, none more so than the family's top cuvée. The 2004 Belle Hélène boasts waves of creamy raspberry fruit framed by wonderfully supple tannins. Long-lasting on the finish, it's already delicious but should develop additional complexity through 2015.",199.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"A big step up from Jaboulet's La Petite Chapelle, this is on a par with some of Jaboulet's past efforts. It's richly concentrated, yet nuanced, with notes of blood and mineral added to ripe cassis fruit and accented by hints of vanilla and spice. The tannins form an almost creamy texture in the mouth, and the finish lingers a good long time. Drink 2012–2025.",215.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Toasty on the nose, accented by hints of peach, then turning honeyed and rich on the palate, with a slightly oily texture. Layers of velvety richness fill the mouth, with just enough acid to leave a lasting finish.",90.00,Rhône_Valley,Marsanne
"Powerful and intense without going over the top, this is a fine example of white Hermitage. The golden straw color gives a first indication of its richness, followed by scents of honey, even a hint of butterscotch. It's unctuous in the mouth, boasting flavors of grilled nuts and stone fruits, and finishing with just a touch of warmth.",50.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"Wonderfully floral and spicy on the nose, with hints of anise that add nuance to the layers of raspberry fruit. Stéphane Ogier claims he adores the 2004 vintage, and with wines like this, why shouldn't he? This finishes lush and long, and although already approachable, should age effortlessly through at least 2015.",180.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Under the same ownership as Château Caronne-Saint-Gemme, this, too is in a soft, ripe style, which would benefit from early drinking. It's attractive, lightly toasty and with good black fruits and acidity.",14.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A curiously earthy aroma announces a wine that is light, somewhat barnyard, the fruit behind the tannin. It has a juicy element leading to final cranberry acidity.",44.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
Very sweet aromas of ripe red and white cherries and canned peaches belie this wine's dry palate while the shortish finish shows an appealing citrusy crispness. Firm acidity will allow this wine to keep for several years but it's probably best drunk now.,20.00,Alsace,Riesling
"A very pretty, well-balanced Chard from South of France powerhouse Gérard Bertrand. Baked peaches, pretty yellow florals and a touch of honeysuckle integrate seamlessly in the creamy mouth. The finish shows notes of sweet citrus, leaving a clean and refreshing impression on the palate.",13.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"Certainly crisp, but also showing some tropical fruit characters, this is clean, ripe Sauvignon Blanc. The aftertaste has hints of white currants. Screwcap.",15.00,Burgundy,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Another great value from Arrogant Frog, this Viognier-Chard blend is fresh and delicious with flavors of rich wood-grilled apple, yellow florals, peach and toast. Medium weight and well balanced with a long finish. Drink now.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay-Viognier
"Sure it's oaky, but it tastes good, with the subtle menthol and bold vanilla flavors serving to highlight bright cherries. The silky texture is a highlight, then the finish shows off juicy fruit and fine tannins.",11.00,Provence,Red_Blend
"The dark color tells you right away this is no ordinary vin de pays. Then you sniff it and get cedar, black currants and blackberries. The finish has juicy acidity and dusty tannins, suggesting a couple years' cellaring may be warranted. Impressive.",14.00,Rhône_Valley,Cabernet_Sauvignon-Syrah
"A delightful blend of cracked black pepper, blackberries and hung game aromas lead into a surprisingly plush mouthfeel that's laden with cherry and berry fruit. The finish blends in some dark coffee flavors for extra complexity.",10.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Impressive dark purple in color, this powerful vin carries lots of toasted-oak aromas: menthol and cedar in particular. There's some promising dark fruit underneath it all that should emerge in a couple years' time. Less exciting than this winery's 1996, which leads to the question: could the creation of a luxury cuvée have had an effect on the quality of this wine?",20.00,Southwest_France,Red_Blend
"While Vacheron is famed for its reds, the whites are of an equal, if not greater, class. This big, dense, rounded wine is from one of the sunniest vineyards in Sancerre, and that shows in its power and richness. The fruits are tropical, white peach, kiwi and green plums, with just a hint of yeast. Let this age for a year.",27.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A cherry-picked blend of six estate parcels, the 2003 Château d'Ampuis fills the gap in the Guigal hierarchy between the largely négoce Brune et Blonde and the single-vineyard bottlings. Aged 38 months in new French oak, there's an understandable layer of vanilla and spice, but also layers of lush berry fruit. Creamy and rich, with a long, surprisingly elegant finish. Drink now–2020.",175.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"In a cool vintage like 2004, Sorrel's parcels in the warmest terroirs of the hill (Le Méal and Les Greffieux) can outperform. This is less rich than the 2005, but still amazingly flattering, filled with spicy complexity and red fruit. Drink now–2020.",140.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Perhaps the most complete wine in the current lineup is this blend of one-third each Carignan, Mourvèdre and Syrah, which boasts a delicious combination of Carignan's cinnamon spice, Mourvèdre's dark, plummy fruit and Syrah's savory notes. Picks up hints of smoke and anise on the long finish.",20.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Wood aged, giving a softly smoky and creamy style of wine, the acidity a whisper in the background of green plums and toast. This is smooth, ripe and richly full-bodied, a powerful wine that could still take some aging.",36.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Possessed of a powerful charred, espresso-like character on the nose,   this isn't that fruit expressive at first, but on the palate black olive and black cherry flavors surge forward, framed by layered tannins and showing great persistence. Needs time; try from 2012.",129.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Easily marries smoky notes from new oak with minerally aromas, then layers on incredibly creamy-textured red cherry-berry fruit, dense and rich. Supple tannins provide focus on the long finish. Drink 2010–2020.",80.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"The wine is full-bodied, with hints of smoke, and with a deliciously fresh, crisp apple aftertaste. It is powerful and rich while not losing any elegance.",78.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Bursting with scents of honey and toast, this is a broad, moderately rich example of Marsanne. There's a bit of apricot, and also toasted cereal grains, lingering elegantly on the finish. Drink now.",30.00,Rhône_Valley,Marsanne
"Rather nutty—almonds—on the nose, then broadening out on the palate into apricots and oranges. This is more focused and crisp than many white Hermitages, with a long, modestly tannic finish. It may age well, or it may be trying too hard and best consumed young.",80.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"A smooth, vanilla-flavored wine that shows good black currant flavors. There are soft tannins, some wood notes, but there is also a stalky dryness in the background. The aftertaste leaves wood and dry fruit in equal proportions. Imported by Wine Frog.",26.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Starts off with a faint chemical odor that blows off quickly, allowing the more appealing notes of small white flowers, pear and toasted hazlenut to come through. Medium weight in the mouth with a solid, roasty finish. A great choice for barbecue or grilled chicken.",11.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"Soft and lush, this wine opens with papaya, honey and pear underpinning a spicy top note. It's not quite as complex in the mouth, and noticeably off-dry. A good choice with fruit salad. Drink now.",25.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"There are plenty of dry tannins here, dominating light red berry and hedgerow fruits. It is never going to be a big wine, but the tannins should soften in a year to leave a fresh, fruity wine.",47.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"An exquisitely pretty wine, with green apple and white cherry fruit shot through with an intriguing cardamon note. The finish is crisp and dry with hints of lemon and Turkish figs. Perfect for warm weather entertaining.",19.00,Provence,Rosé
"A moderate-weight, citrus-infused Chard with soft green apple and dandelion floral accents. A crisp, clean finish and medium acidity makes this an excellent choice for warm weather sipping.",14.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"Although this wine is missing the seductive nose of many Gewürztraminers, it is impressive in the mouth with a rich texture and intense notes of rose water and cloves. Slight residual sugar and soft acidity make it a good partner for seafood in a fruit-based preparation.",21.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
The nose of Concord grapes is immediately appealing and leads to notes of overripe raspberries. Substantial residual sugar in combination with medium acidity render this a good for pool-side sipping or with paté.,15.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"Soft red apple, white peach and delicate white florals unfold in the nose, while toastier notes of baked apple and brioche appear in the mouth. Round and full, there's not a lot of complexity here but it's straightforward, satisfying and quite easy to drink.",14.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay-Viognier
"With its bold, jammy blackberries and a hint of black pepper on the nose, this wine is all about delivering a flavor punch. Straightforward berry fruit is tinged with licorice in a bulky but satisfying package.",10.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Cocoa and cedar aromas dominate the bouquet, but then some dark fruit emerges on the palate. It's dense, rich and flavorful, but lacks the elegance and finesse to score higher.",14.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Dark earth and tobacco spice the aromas of this grand cru, followed by flavors of black cherries and herbs. The Cabernet Franc portion shines clearly through as a distinctive weediness, but it's somewhat balanced by roasted black cherries and only a hint of espresso-like oak.",35.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Straightforward and easy to drink with dominating juicy red fruit supported by accents of spice and menthol. Fresh and lively, light in the mouth with a short but clean finish.",12.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Delas's big bottling of Hermitage blends three sites, including Les Bessards and L'Hermite to make a Hermitage that should be relatively easy to find at close to 2,000 cases produced. The 2005 is a muscular wine with dusty tannins that demands cellaring, even though it does show attractive notes of cassis and a distinctive blood-iron-mineral streak. Try after 2015.",67.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"From old vines on chalky soil, this wine minerality as well as concentration. It is crisp but full, ripe but fresh. There's a touch of spiciness to complement the ripe green plum and apple skin flavors.",30.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Bottled only a few months prior to this tasting, the wine was still rather closed aromatically, but wonderfully ripe and supple on the palate. Waves of superripe, creamy-textured red fruit and vanilla flavors finish long, bolstered by firm tannins. Drink 2010–2018.",40.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"A selection of Voge's oldest vines from an especially granitic southeastern exposure, this is more of everything than the Vieilles Vignes bottling—more intense, smoky, dense and dark. The mouthfeel is rich and nearly syrupy, while the flavors burst with cherries and spice that linger on the finish.",100.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Crisp, clean and clear Chardonnay, soft and attractive, the fruit on the citrus side, but with some red apple skin juice to make it richer.",24.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Fine, simple red Burgundy, with soft tannins, jellied raspberry flavors good broad texture. Obviously not for aging, but a pleasure to drink.",24.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Simple, attractive, light Chardonnay. Green fruits and pear juice layer with acidity and a soft texture. With its lively, crisp finish, the wine is ready to drink.",13.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Aromas of yellow flowers and soft sweet spice take time to appear on the bouquet of this Grenache-based white. Round and flabby, with notes of melon, celery and nectarine in the mouth. The finish is medium with hints of toast.",24.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,White_Blend
"A very flowery interpretation with gardenia, freesia and carnations on the nose that carry over to the palate where they merge with fresh orange peel. There's only moderate intensity and complexity here, but the exceptionally pretty nose and the crisp, linear finish make for a nice overall package. Serve with flounder. Should be drunk up in a year or two.",14.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Crisp and fresh with lively flavors of apple slices, clementine supremes, nectarine and a touch of honeysuckle. Lighter weight with good balance and a clean finish. The 2009 should be available, so drink up the '08 now.",9.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A great value and a good choice for barbecue or summer seafood dishes. Moderate notes of small red berries, wild strawberry and raspberry dominate the creamy mouth along with a hint of soft garrigue herbs on the finish.",9.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé
"A négociant bottling from the ubiquitous Yvon Mau, this wine proudly boasts élevé en futs du chene on the label. You can certainly notice it in the cedary aromas and flavors, but it's adequately balanced by cassis and tobacco flavors. The fruit tastes a touch overripe, but it seems to work well here.",10.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Built along traditional lines, this claret features soft plummy Merlot fruit accented by leafy tobacco and cassis. Its cedary leanness makes it an ideal foil for rich meat dishes.",15.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A solid claret, with cherry and plum fruit accented by dried herbs and a touch of vanilla. This is a basic Saint-Emilion that stays true to its appellation and doesn't try to be more than it is: a user-friendly wine that goes down easy.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Blueberry fruit mingles with cinnamon-tinged oak spice on the nose and palate of this offering. There's even enough depth and complexity to make it more than a simple quaff, worthy of washing down simply roasted chicken perhaps.",18.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Most everyone's first Bordeaux is back for another year, with fruity black-cherry aromas spiked with just a touch of vanilla and cedar. Juicy acidity keeps this crowd-pleaser lively through the lightly tannic finish. A good introduction to the genre.",11.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Pure Grenache, and a wonderful expression of the variety. There's a bit of white pepper upfront, followed by hints of peach or apricot, then rich black cherry fruit framed by silky tannins. Dry and peppery on the finish.",22.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Grenache
"A selection from old vines and made only in good years, Landrat-Guyollot's Carte Noire is rich and creamy, with concentrated white and yellow fruit flavors, some melon, white currants and pink grapefruit. Weighty, promising aging over 5 years.",33.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"From old vines, partially destemmed and aged in old (3–10 years) barrels, this is a wonderfully pure expression of Cornas. Think fresh blueberries with a sprinkling of clove and a dash of black pepper. Firm tannins mark the finish; this needs at least five more years of aging.",49.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Denser and more minerally than Jaboulet's Les Grandes Terrasses bottling, this is a serious Cornas, brimming with blood and iron notes wrapped in a richly tannic cloak. Chewy but ripe, this should be long-lived. Drink from 2012.",112.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Makes a splashy entrance, flashing hints of smoke, toast and vanilla, but there's a firm core of mineral and spice at the heart of this wine that will need some time to emerge. Right now the texture is rich, the red fruit forward, but the wine finishes a bit tough and crisp. Drink 2010–2018.",65.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"This is the 100% Syrah cuvée, and it shows powerful varietal character in its smoky, peppery, meaty aromas and flavors. Despite a slightly creamy texture, it doesn't come across as heavy or overbearing.",30.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
"This ripe and creamy wine is full of great flinty and green fruit flavors. It is a pure, fresh expression of the chalk soil Sauvignon, with its crisp aftertaste.",19.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Fragrantly herbal and peppery on the nose, even coming a little close to vegetal before pulling back and showing more cherry fruit. This is a lightweight effort, but very pretty and perfumed, ideal for drinking while waiting for the blockbuster 2003 to mature. Drink now–2015.",96.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"It's smoky, toasty and even a bit bacon-scented from its upbringing in 100% new French oak, but this is also a lush, warm, inviting mouthful of wine, filled with cassis fruit and framed by spicy wood. It's 95% Merlot from a hot vintage, so not likely to age all that long, but it's certainly delicious now.",27.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This grand cru Riesling screams of terroir. Strong aromas of petrol, pineapple and honey emanate from the glass while flavors of ripe red delicious apple, bergamot and ruby red grapefruit dance on your palate. Medium-full body and a long mineral finish add the finishing touches to this beauty.",34.00,Alsace,Riesling
Attractive fresh raspberry fruit and a touch of acidity mark this bright clean wine.,15.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Rodet's basic red Burgundy draws on fruit from the firm's local Mercurey region, giving the wine a warmth and softness. There is a core of dryness, but this is generally soft and perfumed.",18.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Overtly fruity upfront, with a green apple, pineapple, papaya and spiced orange character that trails off to a simple citrus note in the mouth. The dry, short-to-medium finish is shot through with tobacco notes. Drink up.",20.00,Provence,Rosé
"Lemon and hay aromas on the nose get overtaken by a strong flavor of fall leaves in the mouth. Fairly dry and medium-bodied, this is a good choice with a wide variety of lighter fish and chicken dishes. But pick this one up soon for it's starting to show its age.",27.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"This wine makes you work harder than many of its neighbors to find the flavor but it's worth the effort when you uncover an intriguing mélange of hay, apricot and early summer fruits. The crisp, minerally finish puts one in mind of a platter of choucroute garnie. Drink now to 2013.",15.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Not overdone or overripe, here's a rich Chard that boasts fresh peach and red apple notes with notes of tropical fruit acidity. Clean and solid with a medium mouthfeel; an easy-drinking choice that's perfect for company.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"Bears a striking resemblance to blueberry pie in its aromas. Lighter than expected on the palate, before fading on the finish. A pleasant lunch mate to pâté or charcouterie.",8.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Another Cahors from the stable of Alain-Dominque Perrin, this one is the entry-level wine, made to be more accessible than his flagship wine from Château Lagrezette or the luxury cuvée. There's still plenty of toasty oak, but also some raspberry-cherry fruit and green tobacco on the finish.",11.00,Southwest_France,Red_Blend
"This well-known Burgundy négociant has branched out into the Rhône, like so many others have before. The good news is that the wine is bursting with bright cherry flavors—tart and juicy. Would make a nice burger or sandwich accompaniment.",8.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"With a nose of spicy green herbs—notably tarragon—and flavors of lemon and pink grapefruit, this no-nonsense blend of 50% Sauvignon Blanc and 50% Sémillon goes down easy and clean. The crisp finish is a good palate-cleanser.",9.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"From a vintage known for its readily-approachable wines, this grand cru Saint-Emilion shows surprising structure. Some toasty oak frames delicate black-cherry fruit. Black tea notes on the finish carry more tannins than the fruit can handle in the long run, so catch this one soon before it heads south.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Features attractive aromas of chocolate, prunes, leather and soy sauce that are fairly complex and mature. The flavors are similar, with touches of earth and black cherries. Drink now.",20.00,Provence,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Shows its Right Bank roots in Merlot and Cab Franc-derived red fruit and herb flavors: strawberry, tomato and rhubarb. Turns leathery and earthy, with some hints of toast on the finish.",15.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Pretty strawberries and cherries are paired with softly minty nuances in this lightweight charmer. No, there's not a lot of intensity, but you could even serve it slightly chilled as a picnic wine.",8.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"I know Bordeaux isn't known for being fruit-driven, but this paucity of fruit in a wine that's 50% Merlot (from a vintage that favored this variety's development) is hard to fathom. Leather and old wood combine with earth and mushrooms. There's decent weight and intensity here, so if these are flavors you look for this is an example to seek out.",10.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This one comes from the Mouton branch of the Rothschilds. Showing its age a bit already, with mature apple and wood varnish aromas that perk up a bit on the palate, where they pick up some attractive lemon nuances.",14.00,Bordeaux,White_Blend
"After 30 months in new oak, this needs some time to pull itself together. Right now, it's dominated by oaky notes of vanilla and spice. There does appear to be plenty of old-vine material underneath—you can ferret out hints of apricot and almond skin—so this rating may look stingy in 10 or more years.",175.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"A spicy, muscular example of Hermitage, this wine features red currant flavors tinged with darker shades of cassis and chocolate. It's slightly creamy in the mouth, turning dry and tannnic on the finish. Drink 2010–2020.",80.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Like the 2005, this is a nutty wine, but it is also a touch crisper and should prove to be marginally longer-lived. Broad and mouthcoating, with layers of richness.",75.00,Rhône_Valley,Marsanne
"This is a powerful, rich white Hermitage with overtones of buttered nuts. It's slightly waxy, with hints of stone fruit as well. Already shows some hints of age, so this may be best consumed young.",50.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"Very spicy, but also possessing enough cassis and cherry fruit to make a wonderful marriage. The lovely velvety texture just turns a tad dry on the finish; give it five years in the cellar.",75.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"A delicious and richly creamy wine, full-bodied, with green plum and pink grapefruit flavors. There's freshness, but also power. Still young, just bottled, this wine will develop over 4–5 years. Les Pentes, slopes, refers to the slope of the vineyard.",23.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A bit light, in the style of the vintage, but with wonderfully intricate spice complexity wrapped around leather and red fruit. The creamy mouthfeel gives this wine a sense of delicacy not often found in Hermitage. Drink this pretty wine over the next 7–10 years.",75.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Slightly herbal on the nose, without the great intensity of some vintages, but still having pretty peppered raspberry aromas. This is a bit light in weight, but wonderfully supple, elegant and well-balanced. Finishes long, with silky tannins and a touch of cranberry. Drink now–2014.",91.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Full-bodied and deliciously supple, with layers of black cherries, plum, tea and exotic spices that gently caress the palate. Long and silky on the finish, making it approachable now, but it should only improve over the next several years. Imported by Vintus LLC.",150.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Shows remarkable minerality and restraint for a 2003, with a nuanced nose of crushed stone and smoke, then delivers rich, enveloping flavors of honey, minerals and tree fruits. Tremendous length on the mouthcoating finish is its final indication of quality. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",65.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Tasted twice, two months apart. This wine was fabulous on both occasions, combining the fat, fleshy ripeness and honeyed fruit of the vintage with the minerality of its grand cru site. Smoke, citrus and toasted nuts round out the flavors, which finish long and complex. Delicious now, but should hold several years at least. Imported by Vintus LLC.",150.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"While the aromas on this example are not perfectly clean, they are followed by a burst of flavor that makes up for it all. Indian spices and macadamia nuts are punctuated by apricot fruit and wrapped up in a glossy texture. Long, nutty finish. Drink now to one year.",37.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"On the austere side, with fruit that has considerable—perhaps too much—freshness. Berry flavors and tannins verge on stalky, and the acidity gives the wine a light aftertaste.",47.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Subtle in approach, in keeping with the Dopff & Irion house style, this wine shows good minerality on the nose and moderate intensity in the mouth. Not overpowered by superripe flavors—the themes here are apple and pear. The dry, citrusy finish makes this a good pairing for a meaty fish such as swordfish or tuna.",20.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"A classic nose of roses and Asian spice precedes an intense palate with substantial residual sugar. Medium, perfumed finish. Serve with sweeter Thai dishes.",16.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"An attractive Mâcon, with some rich character, forward white fruits and a delicious apéritif style of freshness and acidity.",15.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Fresh and vibrant on the nose with green citrus, peach and sweet pink florals. The soft fruit is nicely balanced, ending with a simple, clean finish.",11.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,White_Blend
"Quite mature now, this rosé shows apple, lemon and spice character that fades quickly to a cedar note. It's dry, with a final note of cumin. Drink now.",16.00,Provence,Rosé
"While it certainly has bright acidity and green fruit flavors, this is quite creamy in texture for an Aligoté, its angles softened and rounded. The finale is fresh, with a more citrus character.",25.00,Burgundy,Aligoté
"A light, toffee-and-caramel-tinged red that seems to be fading. Some earth and cherry flavors provide for acceptable drinking now, but this wine is headed south. Get to it soon.",12.00,Provence,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A famous old brand that seems to be living off past glory, this year's edition is quite neutral in aroma and flavor; you have to work to pick out some mild herb and citrus, but it does show a nice spicy, green-peppercorn character on the finish.",11.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"The nose features some plum and faint cedar aromas, but not a lot of intensity; the light black-cherry and cedar flavors incorporate some earthy nuances on the finish. Light and correct, but where's the beef?",9.00,Bordeaux,Merlot
A white this age should be fresh and crisp; this one is a bit dull and shows only faint bitter lemon flavors on the finish to go with tired apple aromas.,8.00,Southwest_France,White_Blend
"Picture grandma standing over a pot of stewed prunes, which fill the dusty old house with their sickly aromas. Cooked, earthy and rustic, this wine has little going for it. Just barely acceptable.",11.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Red_Blend
"From a vineyard planted in 1892, this 100% Carignan features exciting spice-driven notes that resemble cinnamon red hots. It's a lighter, more feminine style than the other Lignère wines on the palate, but very flavorful, showing great freshness on the finish.",30.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Carignan
"An intense, very pure expression of Sauvignon Blanc, with delicious green fruits, flavors of white peaches, grapefruit and some spice. To taste, the fruit is fresh but concentrated, leaving a big mouthful of green and herbs.",25.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Seems to have almost a hint of acetate on the nose, but there's no evidence of volatility on the mildly creamy palate, where bright cherry fruit is accented by cracked peppercorns. Turns a bit chewier on the finish, but remains balanced. Drink 2008–2014.",82.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"It's quite a flourish of a name that refers to the vineyard from which this wine comes. This 2004 is now mature, a combination of honey, nuts and a hint of green asparagus and aromas of undergrowth. Go for this wine for its secondary flavors, not the fruit, and then it becomes delicious.",32.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"For a cuvée intended to be drunk young, this is packed with material. It's thick and dense with jammy raspberry fruit, a product of the hot vintage and tiny yields. Still slightly tannic, so hold off another couple of years. Drink 2010–2020.",57.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"A barrel-fermented blend of Marsanne and Roussanne, this toasty, leesy, custardy wine is rather rich on the palate, with honeyed cereal flavors and peach overtones that linger on the finish.",32.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"Chapoutier's biggest cuvée of Hermitage is the relatively affordable Monier de Sizeranne, a smoky, spicy rendition that's a pretty classic rendition. Peppery notes accent the raspberry, cherry and red fruit flavors that finish with crisp acids. Nicely done, with silky tannins on the finish. Drink now–2015.",90.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"A powerful, fat, still young wine, full of yeast flavors, green apples, plums and with a fine, tight structure—this is a food wine that could certainly age, maybe over 3 to 4 years.",23.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Very fruit-forward and lush, especially considering the generally tannic nature of the 2005 vintage in the northern Rhône. Minerally notes accent red cherries and plums, with just a touch of toast and vanilla in the background. Drink now–2015.",50.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Nicely defined on the nose, with precise spice and herbal notes that add complexity to the crunchy red fruit flavors. Ripe tannins and an easy finish make for an approachable Hermitage that should be consumed on the young side. Drink now–2015.",90.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Complex from the first sniff, where it seems herbal, briary and even a bit peppery but simultaneously bacony, spicy and laced with red cherries. On the palate, it's mostly about sous-bois and spice, with just enough cherry fruit for balance. Briary and a bit drying on the finish, but the bet here is that this wine will age superbly. Try after 2010. Imported by Vintus LLC.",130.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Richly honeyed on the nose, with layers of mineral that lure you in. Tastes like honey-drizzled wet riverstones with a squeeze of citrus—mouthfilling yet precise. Long and intense on the finish. Imported by Monsieur Henri Wine Co.",90.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Full-bodied, dense and tannic, this 2003 is built for the long haul. Cedar, chocolate and plum mark the nose, then the palate. Firm yet plush on the finish. Worth holding until 2013 or longer. Imported by Vintus LLC.",140.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"One of the best values in the Le Moine lineup, this isn't all that dark, but don't let looks deceive you. The aromas are lovely, boasting hints of roses and violets, while the mouthfeel is supple. Picks up spice notes on the silky finish. Immediately delicious, but should hold 5–8 years. Imported by Vintus LLC.",75.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Rich and ripe, with buttery, toasty aromas that are also reminiscent of bacon fat. Full-bodied, with ample apple and citrus fruit flavors that come to a climax in the long, hazelnut-tinged finish. Lovely, but with its rather low acidity, it looks to be a Burgundy to drink rather than to cellar. Imported by Vintus LLC.",100.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Smoky, toasty aromas lead into a wine that brings some fruit tannins to the mix, with flavors of sweet plums and spice to go with the wood. The wine has some potential, perhaps for aging 2-3 years.",23.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Chitry lies just outside the Chablis appellation area, giving a wine that has some of the classic steely character but is more rounded and less focused. Pleasing Chardonnay, finishes with an attractive vanilla touch.",13.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Pleasant, soft wine, easy to drink, its fruits round and somewhat dilute. It doesn't resonate, but is certainly fresh and crisp.",45.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A solidly structured rosé with a bit of weight and great ripeness in the mouth. Strawberry and somewhat medicinal cherry fill the bouquet and palate, with a touch of herbaceousness on the finish.",15.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé
"A decent Chard at an attractive price. Light intensity on the nose with suggestions of citrus and pear slices. The mouth is just as subtle, leading through to the short but clean finish.",9.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
The fruit seems a bit faded but the nose offers up some pleasant mushroom notes. The lightweight palate shows dusty tannins and intense cherry notes that linger on the earthy finish. Drink up.,55.00,Alsace,Pinot_Noir
"Soft and broad, a little unfocused, the fruit showing pear juice and green apple skins. It feels light, juicy, missing concentration, and there's a caramel toast aftertaste.",18.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Lightweight wine that seems somewhat dilute with flavors of green plums, bright acidity and a very soft texture.",17.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
A weighty rosé that offers loads of intense red berries and peaches on the nose followed by ripe cherry and red plum flesh in the mouth. Easy to drink with satisfying flavors and a clean finish.,10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé
Light pink in the glass with soft aromas and flavors of strawberry and blueberry. Delicate and refreshing; a great choice for hot summer days.,16.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé
"With prominent biscuit notes, this crémant announces its allegiance to the elegant Champagne style. It follows through with a fine mousse and a light impression in the mouth. A few pear and earth aroams peek through on the fleeting finish. Drink up.",20.00,Alsace,Chardonnay
"An interesting Chard that offers quite sweet notes of stewed peaches, orange marmalade and overripe honeydew. Big and a bit clumsy in the mouth, more vibrancy and freshness is needed to keep things in better balance. However, if you like 'em sweeter, this one's for you.",12.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"This '07 is a bit tired already, with a muted nose offering up subtle hints of strawberry hull and peach fuzz. The mouth offers a bit more by way of red currant, rhubarb and limey citrus notes. The finish, though a bit tart, is crisp and clean.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé
"A beautiful example of Alsace Riesling. Notes of honey, petrol and sweet spice invite you in to a full-bodied mouthful of minerality, honeydew and baked apple. The crisp acidity complements the inherent sweeter characteristics of the wine, bringing everything into perfect harmony. With a clean, lingering finish, this Riesling only leaves you ready for more.",23.00,Alsace,Riesling
"A step up from Allemand's Chaillot bottling, the 2004 Reynard boasts more intense cassis fruit and even some licorice and spice notes. It's rich, layered and tannic, needing some time to show its best. Drink 2010–2020.",96.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Almost tropical in its ripeness, this is exotically rich. It is full-bodied, concentrated, powered by white peaches and spliced with green berry fruits. A touch of smokiness adds complexity.",32.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Big-hearted and round, this is a full wine, with apple pie and cream flavors leading to a crisp, mineral aftertaste. It's delicious, very drinkable now, packed with ripe but refreshing fruit.",26.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Slightly lighter than the 2004, this is still a serious Riesling. Aromas of petrol, minerality and grapefruit complement flavors of apple skin and muted sweet spice, bringing together a medium-bodied wine with a long minerally finish. Showing nicely now, but also the potential to age.",44.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Broad, buttery and rich, this is a powerful, low-acid white Hermitage. It's loaded with nutty elements and body, less so with fruit and finesse.",75.00,Rhône_Valley,Marsanne
"Made from purchased grapes (Jaboulet finally acquired 1.5 hectares of Côte-Rôtie in 2006), this is a nicely textured, creamy wine that avoids tannic overload or heaviness, allowing the floral, spicy side of the appellation to shine. Drink now–2015.",80.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"A lovely, elegant example of Côte-Rôtie, with scents of violets and licorice accenting plum and blackberry fruit. Supple and easygoing, with a hint of tea on the finish. Drink now–2014.",79.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Full and ripe, this wine is softly rich rather than mineral, but retains plenty of fresh, crisp green fruit flavors, touched with spice and pepper.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"With notes of wet stones, petrol, lime and apple, this plump, medium-intensity wine balances nicely. Hints of mint and pineapple core are also exposed on the palate. A persistent finish with a slightly oily viscosity lingers long after the wine is gone. Imported by Maison Marques et Domaines.",20.00,Alsace,Riesling
"This is a serious selection for those who love a little more weight. Chock full of honey, sweet spice and butterscotch, you know what you're getting into from the first whiff. The palate only further complements the nose with the flavor of ripe, red apples elevating the sweeter aromas. Full- bodied and rich with a long, spicy finish.",38.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Young, very fruity with green plum and currant flavors, this still has a yeasty quality from the lees. Drink in 2008; it's going to be deliciously fruity and fresh, with great ripe fruit.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A simple but easy-to-drink Chardonnay with soft aromas and flavors of ripe red apple and pear. Medium weight with a solid, clean finish.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"Open, soft, creamy, along with a candied fruit character. There is freshness here, with the acidity dominant on the finish.",15.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"There's not a lot of intensity here, but some good lemony crispness and an intriguing popcorn note. Drink now, this one is on fast fade.",10.00,Rhône_Valley,Rosé
"Strawberry jam aromas emerge on a wine that is light, with a bitter edge, but also with soft fruit, a tiny modicum of tannin and acidity.",17.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Bright and sassy, this light-hearted Rhône rosé has fresh spice and lemon zest scents and a thread of cinnamon running through the palate. Ends on a short citrus note. Drink up before the fresh fruit fades.",13.00,Rhône_Valley,Rosé
"Finely balanced, this has plenty of weight, which shines with the fresh lemon, pear and sweet grapefruit flavors. There is some wood there, but just a hint to give texture. A big success from a fine white wine vintage, and worth aging for 3–4 years.",40.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Ripe, tropical fruit flavors from super-ripe grapes. That seems to be the way Henry Natter works, and the result is a soft, smooth wine, with a touch of caramel, quince and white peach flavors. The acidity is only apparent towards the end.",24.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"An interesting wine that combines slightly herbal notes with confected, fruity ones in a harmonious way. Pepper and crushed red fruits are carried on a creamy texture, punctuated by crisp acids and firm tannins on the finish. Drink 2008-2015.",30.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"A weighty style of Sancerre, full-bodied and powerful with plenty of big, bold fruit flavors. It's round, ripe and dense, able to hold its own against many spicy food dishes.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"With their biodynamic vineyards, it's no wonder that the Vacherons are able to produce such intense fruit, even in their simplest wines. This is fresh but concentrated, with summer currants and pink grapefruit enriched by a firm structure.",27.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Produced from young vines, this is Paris' early-drinking Cornas. It's fresh, fruity and not too tannic, with a dry, cinnamon-like overlay to the superripe blueberry fruit. Finishes crisp.",40.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Fresh, almost floral, with a touch of almonds as well. This is a nicely balanced blend of the richness and weight of Marsanne and its honeyed stone-fruit flavors, with the freshness retained by fermenting in stainless steel. Drink now.",28.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"Starts off with some forceful charred aromas and some rustic, unintegrated notes on the finish, but give this wine some time to settle down and it shines. Grilled peaches and roasted cashews mingle easily with mineral notes, and what the finish lacks in finesse at this stage it makes up in power. Better in 2008. Imported by Vintus LLC.",85.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"The dominant pear and melon notes actually come across as a bit austere despite the wine not being hugely mineral upfront. Where this wine shows its pedigree is on the long finish, which picks up anise and flint notes and a rich, plush texture. Imported by Monsieur Henri Wine Co.",66.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"From the village of Epineuil, north of Chablis, comes this lightweight red with attractive fresh fruits, but a curious petrol aroma. It is soft and light, although there is a hint of dry tannins. Screwcap.",19.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"The 2007 vintage was not kind to red wines from the Hautes Côtes, the vineyards behind the main slope of Burgundy. Manuel Olivier has made an attractively fresh, strawberry-flavored wine, but it lacks intensity, relying on soft fruit and fresh acidity.",20.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"With a touch of wood, this wine has some good weight to balance the very fresh raspberry and crisp berry acidity. There is a toasty element, but crisp fruit dominates.",18.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Notes of wet stones and almonds vie with less appealing aromas of French cheese on the nose. The taut, straightforward palate shows lemon flavors and has a slight astringency on the finish. One could do much worse for the modest price.",12.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Beautifully mature wine in the dry Alfred Gratien style. It has grapefruit flavors, but the yeast, toast, almonds and dried herbs character are now fully developed. A great wine.",118.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A ripe, dry wine with delicious mature fruit, touched by wood from barrel fermentation. Grapefruit, almonds, some yeastiness all give complexity, as does the acidity that follows this intense wine right through to the finish.",143.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Rich and creamy, this wine has weight as well as the hallmark freshness of 2007. The yellow fruits and spicy pear flavors are smoothed out with spice, with some herbaceous elements and a fine waft of apple skin structure. Worth aging for 3–4 years. Screwcap.",49.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"This is rich, but the balance of the wine is excellent, the wood very much underneath the smooth, opulent apricot and pear fruits. There is spice, which adds a fine piquancy to the texture. The finish is vivid, still young, needing at least five years to age.",80.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Made from 70–80-year-old estate-grown vines, this boasts a tremendously complex and seductive bouquet of smoke, violets, raspberries and blackberries. In the mouth, it's a bit less exciting although still very good; it's juicy and fresh, with some firm tannins that are accentuated by crisp acidity. Give it a few years, then drink up before 2015.",150.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Las Vals is a 600-case bottling of 100% Mourvèdre. It shows plenty of the variety's dark, brooding character, with flavors of chocolate, plum and cola rounded out by a dash of tree bark. Lots of micro-oxygenation has resulted in a creamy, lush mouthfeel, making the wine much more approachable in its youth.",23.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Mourvèdre
"Guigal's Condrieu is a blend of oak- and steel-fermented lots to help preserve some of the Viognier's freshness. The 2005 is a success, featuring scents of honeysuckle and apricot and a touch of toast. It's reasonably rich on the palate, coating the mouth with ripe, peachy flavors, finishing with credible length. Drink now.",50.00,Rhône_Valley,Viognier
"Guigal's entry-level Côte-Rôtie seems rather tannic at this moment, but does have ample spice, cassis and prune flavors. Lacks a bit of richness and flesh; give it a few years' time to come back around. Drink 2009–2015.",70.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Made solely of Marsanne, this is a lightly honeyed wine, redolent of almonds and apricots. Fresh, clean and easy, and while it might age, it's probably best consumed young.",20.00,Rhône_Valley,Marsanne
"One of the winery's larger cuvées at 5,000 cases, this is a blend of Carignan, Mourvèdre, Syrah and Grenache with wonderfully spice-driven aromatics and a creamy-smooth texture on the palate. Drink now.",18.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"If not the best, then one of the best kosher wines we've ever tasted, with smoke, cedar and meat aromas nicely balanced by plummy, chocolaty fruit. A creamy mouthfeel and smooth, easy finish makes it a delight to drink, but consume this Merlot-based wine over the near term. Imported by Royal Wine Corporation.",250.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This mouthfilling Chard adds hints of honey and acacia blossom to luscious aromas of toasted nuts and citrus. Honey, nuts, mineral and citrus notes mingle easily on the palate, while the finish picks up hints of oaky spice and orange peel. Low acid ity suggests early consumption; drink now–2010. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",54.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Rich in ripe fruit on the nose and palate with loads of blueberry, cherry skins and jammy plum. Full in the mouth with a medium-length but clean finish.",15.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé
"The gorgeous nose of petrol, lime and citrus promises more than the mouth can deliver. The dry palate shows some attractive notes of white flowers but is thin and watery. The short finish rounds out the disappointment.",13.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Strawberry and red raspberry are the themes here along with an underlying note of fresh hay. It's dilute, but pleasant in the mouth, winding down to a final note of lemon peel. Should be drunk up before 2011.",10.00,Provence,Rosé
"A lightweight wine, almost tangy in its freshness. Wild strawberry flavors give a great liveliness to a wine that is taut in its acidity.",15.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A truly grassy aroma leads to a fresh, herbaceous and crisp wine. To top its crispness, it also has some weight, wood flavors and a creamy core with a white pear texture. It could benefit from aging, at least three years, to bring out the inherent richness of the wine.",40.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"The top white wine from Chantegrive, this is a smoothly wood-aged wine. However it doesn't lose sight of deliciously fresh, herbaceous fruits which come through crisply. That makes the resulting balance immediately appealing, acidity and spice coming together well. Worth aging for 2–3 years.",23.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Starts off with aromas of petrol, paraffin and melon. On the palate, pineapple, under-ripe stone fruit and lemon pith complement the full body. The medium length of the citrusy finish brings it all together nicely.",17.00,Alsace,Riesling
"A rich, but mineral driven wine, with flavors of quince, citrus and green herbs. This is young but over 2–3 years it will develop into a richer, smoother wine.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"This is one of Alphonse Mellot's simpler wines, a deliciously fresh, summer meadow wine, with herbs and perfumed flowers and a stream of acidity running through.",30.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Peppery and meaty, with stewed plum flavors, this is much more muscular and tannic than Colombo's Côte-Rôtie, yet still lacks the spark seen in his top Cornas bottlings. A bit rustic and wild, but it doesn't seem to have the concentration of fruit to age long term. Drink–2012, with grilled beef.",70.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Though the finish falls off a bit, notes of juicy honeydew, pear and petrol open up for a sublime mouthful of pineapple and lime pulp. Medium-full-bodied, this is a well-balanced and structured offering promising pleasure and satisfaction.",13.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Firm and tannic, with a slightly worrisome astringency. If this comes into balance, this rating may look a couple points stingy in time. Shows an underbrush, briary side to its black cherry and plum flavors, then picks up coffee and spice notes on the finish. Imported by Vintus LLC.",100.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Developed aromas of fall leaves and straw gainsay this wine's youth. We could wish for a bit more fruit here, but the palate shows a silky texture, some nice intensity and an attractive caramel note. Drink up.",30.00,Alsace,Riesling
Not terribly complex but certainly very approachable and easy to drink. Good acidity and medium weight play well with the flavors of orange and apple in the mouth.,9.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"An odd wooly note introduces this spicy white. Asian fruit notes follow while some floral notes come through on the short, watery finish. Drink up.",24.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
A bit of serious minerality has been coaxed out of the frequently frivolous Gewürztraminer in this fairly crisp example. The medium finish shows appealing notes of fresh grapes. Drink up.,22.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"This is classic Pinot Blanc, with pretty white flowers on the nose, a slight spritz enhancing lemony flavors in the mouth and a crisp, refreshing finish. Perfect for poolside sipping, particularly if there is some fish on the grill.",15.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"This lovely wine, a Monopole, is already showing complex, forward fruit with flavors of plum, cherry and cranberry. Soft and fulsome, it shows a light hand with the oak, allowing nuances of tobacco and leather to emerge. Good weight and texture, it seems bound for early glory.",65.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Rion holds back on the new oak, letting the pure, supple fruit speak for itself. This is a muscular Vosne, young and firm, showing excellent focus and structure. Already the finish lingers beautifully, with layers of texture and tightly wrapped fruit. Should cellar well for a decade or more.",52.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Another premier cru from Michel Gros, this one not as elegant and fruity as the Réas. Instead it goes for more ripeness, more tannic weight, and a lot more roasted scents from the barrels. Big, rawboned but undeniably appealing, it has a lot of rough-hewn flavor, dominated by toast, tannin and tobacco.",65.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This is a lovely, fragrant Burgundy, with a smoky/cherry scented nose leading into a rather tight, hard young wine. Hints of rosewater, graham cracker and tobacco are there, along with some green tannins. Medium body and texture; needs more time to show its best stuff.",52.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Scents of graham cracker and malted milk chocolate tickle the nose, while the tart fruit slowly unwinds to reveal cherry and beetroot scents and flavors. Tannic and hard, without immediately showing much sweetness, it seems to put the emphasis on mineral and soil, root and leaf, but may evolve into a very interesting wine.",38.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This needs a good bit of breathing time, then it begins to reveal some cherry lifesaver fruit and a balanced structure with firm acids and medium tannins. A bit chalky in the finish, it's a relatively light style that is pleasant and pretty once it has opened up.",37.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"The nose is dominated by the attractive scents of new French oak, with some hints of pipe tobacco and just a whiff of volatile acidity. It is tight and tannic, a bit ""lifted"" with the VA, and at this point not showing much fruit or complexity, given the price.",65.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Inky and rustic, yet in a refined manner. This is knock-out juice if you like ’em big and flavorful. The full bouquet of grape, raisin, oak, licorice and herb aromas pulls you in and the follow-up palate of dense blackberry flavors with herb and smoke shadings fulfills the promise the nose makes. Loads of oak here, but there’s great depth of fruit for it to play against. A definite keeper; hold for three or four years at least.",30.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Light and elegant, this spicy, lively wine is a gentle joy. There is a precision and refinement evident here that makes other Champagnes seem almost clumsy. The delicate flavors of fresh apple, pear and citrus are further enhanced with pretty cinnamon spice.",30.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Jacquart makes a full-bodied, ripe style of Champagne, with tiny, effusive bubbles. Flavors of slightly overripe apples lead into a mature palate with hints of oxidation. Sherry, nuts, olive oil, vanilla and other less identifiable nuances meld into a rich, ripe, satisfying and complex whole.",38.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This classy example opens with a very floral nose and almost flower-shop aromas. But it’s not at all sweet on the palate, as tangy lime quickly moves to the fore. Impressively light and elegant, it displays some unusual elements and has a fine bead as well as a supple, herb-tinged finish.",37.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Shows some older notes: a bouquet of toasted white bread, cinnamon, brown sugar and smoky yeast, with just the slightest hint of white pepper. Really rich and complex, with supple lime flavors offsetting the earthy impression. Very dry, with an overall excellent palate impression. Should continue to age and grow finer.",38.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Rich and toasty, with tiny bubbles. The bouquet is laced with honey and vanilla scents. The palate suggests nuts and toast, without any noteworthy sweetness despite the demi-sec label. There’s good concentration and a ripe, toasty, slightly oxidized, nutty finish. This would work perfectly with the usual Champagne food suspects: foie gras, triple-cream cheeses and pâté, though it’s probably not the best choice for oysters.",30.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Really fine for a low-acid vintage, there's an intriguing nose here with white pepper, sandalwood and pine-nut elements. There are mature notes to the apple, toast and pepper flavors, good backbone, and the texture is just lovely. This well-developed example still has youthful elements, and closes with a grapefruit-mineral finish that is both relaxed and complex.",70.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Offers an intriguing nose with ginger, lime and floral elements. The mouthfeel is ephemeral—almost too light—but there’s a good case to be made for this style when bubbles are involved. Green apple, an almost lilac note, and lime on the palate. Finishes nicely, too.",27.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A perfect salmon shade, with scents of peaches, cherries and toast. It hits the palate with big, ripe, fresh fruit: crisp apples, peaches, cherries and citrus. Concentrated and full, with a tart, fresh back end that lingers into a cherry-vanilla finish.",52.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Easy to drink with plenty on offer to keep you interested. The nose suggests essences of beeswax, honeysuckle, pear and citrus with the palate conjuring flavors of ripe red apples and baked peaches. Medium-full body and intensity bring the wine into focus while the delicate fruity finish closes nicely.",19.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Made from young vines, giving fresh, but soft flavors. While the concentration may not be there, this makes a delicious light apéritif style, all fruit and crispness.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"This is spicy and herbal but also loaded with cherry fruit, made with grapes grown not far from teh family's Côte-Rôtie vineyards. It's a bit light in body, but nicely savory and true to its northern Rhône origins, with enough structure to hold for 2-3 years.",35.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Sorbe is one of the leading figures in the two small appellations of Reuilly and Quincy. His Reuilly is honeyed, with fresh mandarin and citrus flavors, leading to a soft, open wine, great as an apéritif.",14.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Starts off with oaky notes of vanilla and spice, but then folds in slightly bloody, peppery notes. It shows plenty of red currant fruit, and is fairly powerful, yet with crisp acids and firm tannins. Hold five years.",57.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"A blend of barrel- and tank-fermented wine, this is an attractively floral and fresh Viognier intended for early drinking. There's a hint of honeyed richness to the apricot and pineapple flavors, but it finishes clean and refreshing. Drink now–2008.",35.00,Rhône_Valley,Viognier
"Bottled only three weeks prior to review, this wine may have been suffering a little when it was tasted last May. There's a bit of spice, but the wine just isn't that expressive, showing crisp and tight, with some raw tannins on the finish. Seems to have potential, so hold five years or more before trying.",90.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"This grand cru selection seems to have a bit of everything. Essences of mint, honeydew and apricot are perfectly integrated with flavors of apple, citrus and honey, creating a broad mouthfeel that's coating without being too heavy. A crisp clean finish cuts through the heft to prevent it from falling flat.",30.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Elegant and lighter, in the style of the vintage, with peppery and dried spice notes accenting fresh cherries. Nicely smooth, balanced and easy to drink. Drink–2015.",67.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Flinty yet honeyed at the same time, this full-bodied wine delivers concentrated flavors of pear, melon, dried spices and honey. Easy enough to drink now, yet should hold for at least five years despite relatively low acids. Long and silky-textured on the finish. Imported by Monsieur Henri Wine Co.",66.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Excellent quality for a villages wine, with layers of peaches and tropical fruit over a core of mineral and spice. Full-bodied and harmonious, with a long finish that echoes with peach, mineral and oak. Drink now. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co. —J.C.",37.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This wine could use a bit more zest but it does offer some attractive and approachable aromas of lychee and fresh grapes. The short, appley finish is saved from being flabby by a slight spritz. Drink soon.",17.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"Notes of unwelcome botrytis detract from an already uninspiring nose. The palate is an improvement, however, with attractive flavors of lanolin and gardenia. This medium-bodied wine finishes with a kick of acidity, making it a good partner for fresh shellfish.",20.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"A Riesling for those who want the wine to play second fiddle to the food. The palate is quite crisp, almost bitter, despite a hint of sweetness. Try with grilled calamari.",18.00,Alsace,Riesling
"This Riesling will suit fans of neutral Italian whites. The nose is shy and retiring while the palate is light on its feet, with notes of lemon and wet stones. Bracing acidity, making it a good partner with light fish dishes.",22.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Soft and grassy, with some asparagus flavors, this is ripe, but still vibrant, adding green apples to grapefruit, with some white pears. Easy and rich in the mouth.",26.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Slightly schizophrenic, this wine touts a strange but intriguing gamut of aromas and flavors. The nose presents mild vegetal and ashy powder notes while the palate offers more typical nuances of nectarine and lemon. A tart and fleeting finish counters the somewhat creamy, medium-full body, concluding with a feeling of balance.",17.00,Alsace,Riesling
"The 15th generation of the Clément family to farm in Menetou-Salon, just to the west of Sancerre, makes an elegant Sauvignon Blanc which in its youth shows signs of lees contact and a lightly nutty character over its green fruits. Drink within the next year.",20.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Starts off with fairly soft aromas of honeydew, petrol and steely minerality. More fruit is showcased on the palate with green apple, lime and pineapple core. Medium weight and appropriately balanced, the finish is fresh and crisp.",60.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Made solely from purchased grapes, Colombo's 2004 Côte-Rôtie is a commendable effort that seems a touch delicate. Blueberry fruit fades on the finish, replaced by dustings of wood spice. Drink now.",70.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"With a beautiful polished brass color, this is another typically intense offering from Marc Kreydenweiss. A bouquet full of clove, candied apple and honey lead in to the medium-full mouthfeel saturated with dried apricot and sweet spice. The slightly roasty finish complements the structure.",69.00,Alsace,Riesling
"A classically crisp, herbaceous wine, full of poised fruit, flavors of pink grapefruit and acidity. There's a good texture, touch of tannins, white pear skins. Screwcap.",11.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Shows more acid and minerality than many 2003s. There's apple, pear and citrus, all wrapped around a minerally core, with hints of honey and anise on the finish. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",47.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"On first whiff, it shows big fruit and vanilla, but it settles down on the palate to deliver cedary plum- and cassis-flavored fruit. Finishes long, with some dusty tannins. It's bulky and lacks a bit of grace, but it still makes for a satisfying mouthful of Bordeaux that should improve with time. Imported by Royal Wine Corporation.",100.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A big, rich wine, showing its gorgeous fruit easily. But with a core of dryness, the ripest apricots touched by caramel, it should age well over many years. There is intense power here, still hidden by the youth of the wine, but with final concentration.",200.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Powered by dry botrytis, this is a wine with immense potential. It has weight, complexity and richness, all under the cloak of botrytis. To leaven the power, there is acidity, but this is certainly for aging.",90.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Inherent wet stone and lively citrus entice you with the promise of refreshment. The palate delivers as well with bright green apple and lemon rind. Plump and medium weight in the mouth, it finishes as clean and minerally as anticipated. Imported by Paramount Brands.",12.00,Alsace,Riesling
"From vineyards to the west of Sancerre in the Loire, Sancerrois Alexandre Mellot has produced a classically fresh, simple, very drinkable wine, showing great awareness of the apple and green pear character of Sauvignon Blanc. Drink this year.",10.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"With its heavy bottle and designer label and name, this must qualify as the most expensive looking vin de pays from the Loire. Somehow the wine, while a pleasant, ripe Sauvignon, doesn't live up to the package. But the price is fine, so enjoy a lively, lightly toasty but still fresh green-fruited wine.",14.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Starts off a bit stinky and reductive on the nose, but in the mouth it's fresh and fruity. An easy-drinking Crozes-Hermitage, bursting with cherries, brought into focus by some youthful tannins and crisp acids. Drink now-2012.",22.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Intensely fruity, with layers of fresh ripe peaches and hints of grilled fruit. There are also traces of roasted nuts, vanilla and smoke, making this one pleasurable and complex experience. Nicely expansive and textured in the mouth; the only quibble is that it falls away quickly on the finish. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",73.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Typical flavors of apple, key lime and stony minerality intermingle with hints of dried spice and honey, creating a nicely balanced wine with a clean, dry finish. Solid and remarkably refreshing, this is a great choice for warmer afternoons of light grilling or picnicking.",17.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Pale yellow in color, this offers up ripe and savory flavors all at once. Notes of pear, peach pit and minerality intermingle with the mouthcoating flavors of sweet dried spice, melon and lime oil. Broad and full, the finish is appropriately dusty and short.",24.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Aromas of petrol and waxed apple suggest a fairly intense offering, as does the slightly oily mouthfeel. Strongly present flavors of orange pith and citrus zest counter the viscosity and heft, allowing for a crisp and refreshing finish. Imported by Chapin Cellars LLC.",13.00,Alsace,Riesling
"In effect the second wine of Jaboulet's flagship La Chapelle, this is a lightweight version of Hermitage, with creamy red berry flavors that turn crisp and cranberryish on the finish. Drink now–2015.",96.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"A wine you could sit and smell for a long time, with classic Côte-Rôtie aromas of smoke, pepper and herb twined around a core of raspberry fruit. But on the palate it comes across as a little light and lacking true depth. A pretty, elegant wine with some tea-like tannins on the finish. Drink now–2015.",85.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Minerality and spicy smoke paired with soft Bartlett pear are a nice introduction, followed by flavors of limey citrus, honeydew and petrol. A lean and refreshing wine with a clean snappy finish.",103.00,Alsace,Riesling
"A luxury bottling from the local co-op, this is a blend of wines from mainly Le Méal and L'Hermite. It's a touch light in color—because of the vintage—with a spicy, peppery bouquet and flavors of red fruits and spice. Lacks a bit of richness and depth, but shows good complexity. Drink now–2014.",80.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Light and fresh, this is elegant with green fruits, yellow peach, a mineral layer and citrus. A rambarde was a flat-bottomed boat which used to transport wine from the Loire to Paris.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"An oddity in the modern world of Bordeaux, this is 100% Muscadelle, a variety normally relegated to a miniscule portion of the blend. Honeyed notes of yellow plums or apricots are plump and waxy-textured in the mouth, finishing long but a touch warm. Drink now.",23.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Lighter texture with a clean, citrusy finish, this is a simple quaff made for easy enjoyment. Full of ripe lemon, Granny Smith apple and stone-dust minerality with just a hint of under ripe nectarine.",27.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Intended to offer a taste of Cornas at an earlier age, the 2004 Renaissance features bright strawberry fruit. It's a bit peppery and herbal, with a light, less tannic structure. Approachable now.",57.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"A good value in Chablis, this bottling from the Boisset group offers steely scents of lime and minerals to go with austere, grapefruity flavors. It's a bit plump on the midpalate, yet finishes with enough cut to merit a recommendation. Imported by Boisset America.",32.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A slight disappointment, but still very good, with honey, smoke, caramel and peaches. It's a bit over-the-top from a house known for restraint, but the superripe fruit is backed by some dry minerality. Bold and weighty, but not that long. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",216.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Seems slightly austere on the nose, with modest pear and melon fruit. But this medium-weight wine is more interesting on the palate, where it hints at honey, then flips direction and gives up gravelly stones and tough-skinned pears. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",57.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A beautifully ripe wine, layering all the dense botrytis of the vintage with freshest acidity. It has weight, the texture of grainy honey, ripe yellow fruits, mango and orange zest. Impressive and certainly for aging.",110.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"This 100% Syrah is filled with effusive bright berry fruit, liberally seasoned with a dusting of cracked pepper. It's a little light, but offers an easy-to-drink authentic taste of the northern Rhône at a realistic price.",17.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"From the domaine's young vines, this offering features somewhat restrained aromatics, with just traces of violets and blackberries. But on the palate there's plenty of cassis fruit. No, it's not that rich or lush, but it's pure, supple and easy to drink right out of the gate. Drink now–2012.",78.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
Slightly waxy aromas of paraffin are followed by hints of melon and spice on the nose. The palate is comprised of cinnamon and clove with a secondary burst of citrus shining through. A long and slightly honeyed finish completes this broad and mouthfilling selection.,53.00,Alsace,Riesling
"This is a great example of what more inexpensive Bordeaux could be like with proper care in the vineyards and winery. Scents of chocolate, dried herbs and cassis ease into similar flavors, carried on a medium-weight, slightly creamy palate. Turns spicy and firmer on the finish, suggesting it will last until 2010 or so.",11.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Although there's only about 20% new oak used in this cuvée, it is somewhat apparent on the nose and palate, where cedar, cinnamon and clove take the lead. There's some pretty—some might say Burgundian—fruit, but it's a touch light and herbal.",73.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"A forwardly fruity, lightly mineral wine, all freshness and white berry fruits, elegant and well-balanced with the crisp, apple acidity. A great apéritif style of Sancerre.",25.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A full, rounded wine, with flavors of asparagus, herbs and ripe quinces. There's acidity, some yeastiness and a taut structure. This probably needs another 6 months aging—drink over the winter 2007/8.",24.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"An astonishing nose of peach and bramble with refreshing accents of lemon zest. The intense, off-dry palate of pistachio, pecan and apricot lead to a long, minerally finish. Carries its hefty 15.5% alcohol well. Best now to 2016.",50.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"Profound enough for serious contemplation but with enough broad fruit appeal to serve to a crowd. There's loads of upfront Asian spice and lychee, afloat on a luxurious, sensually textured palate. Notes of geranium and macadamia nuts keep the taste buds entertained and carry over to the lingering finish. The noticeable residual sugar suggests pairing with something slightly sweet, like Tilapia in a mango salsa. Drink now to 2011.",48.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"A flinty, crisp style, with currants, green apples, pink grapefruit. Initially austere, it opens to some richness. The aftertaste, though, is crisp to a fault.",26.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Mainly (85%) Sauvignon Blanc, bolstered by Sémillon, this is rather broad and mouthfilling for a Bordeaux blanc. Ripe flavors of melon, fig and peach turn grassy and crisp on the finish. Drink now.",23.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Well balanced with medium weight, this conjures up notes of honey, bergamot, lime pith and red apple. A tangy, medium-length finish brings it all together. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estate Wines.",40.00,Alsace,Riesling
"A big, solid wine, foursquare and chunky. The fruit directs its plum fruit flavors to richness, some sweetness, with coffee and licorice as added complexity. There is a great tight wood element giving dryness.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"While Redde is based in Pouilly, across the Loire, the family does have vines in Sancerre. This 2005 is a light, yeasty wine, with grassy, herbal flavors and a crisp, intense acidity to finish.",25.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"In this challenging vintage, Colombo's entry-level Cornas is a bit lean and tart, turning crisp and cranberry-like despite having 14% alcohol. Cherry, sandalwood and vanilla flavors are pleasant enough, just without the warmth and flesh of a warmer year.",78.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Full, ripe fruit, flavored with green plum skins and gooseberries. There's great fresh acidity, but there is also a good structure suggesting the wine will age another year. Attractive weight as well.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A rustic wine, with definite barnyard flavors. The fruit has some smoky extract, but the tannins and old wood tastes intrude too much.",19.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"While not strictly part of the Haut-Médoc Château Cambon la Pelouse, this small parcel in Margaux is under the same ownership and vinification. The wine has weight, some solid fruit, with the wood adding polish but not dominating. A well-structured wine for medium-term aging.",40.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"In contrast to the château wine, this reserve from Château Lamothe-Cissac is for aging. It is still firmly tannic, solid and dark with big ripe fruit and spice from the wood. It holds together well, very balanced. Give it five years.",30.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Minerality, peach, melon and sweet pea give way to a fuller bodied mouthfeel with strong intensity. Tropical and honeyed, the finish falls a little short, needing a tinge more acidity to lift those heavy flavors.",27.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Stone dust and ripe green apple fill the nose and palate of this easygoing quaff. A pleasing lemon finish balances the intensity and medium weight, making this a nice, solid selection.",33.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Firmly in the Hugel style, with a certain austerity and steeliness to its character. Modest apple and citrus flavors pick up hints of underripe nectarine, finishing with a burst of citrus. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, LTD.",19.00,Alsace,Riesling
"A highly perfumed wine, with enticing aromas. The palate is tougher, unforgiving, the young structure there to support fresh and concentrated fruit. There is a definite wood element, but it is not overdone. For aging 3–4 years.",47.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Quite funky indeed. Saturated with spice such as anise, clove and rotting apples on the orchard floor, the earthy, full-bodied and slightly viscous nature of this beast is overwhelming. We're not quite sure if this one warrants the hefty price tag attached to it.",77.00,Alsace,Riesling
"From the top Monts Damnés vineyard, this crisp light wine has yeasty flavors that hide the fresh grapefruit flavors. There is pleasant acidity at the back, along with some green apple skin. Will be ready by the beginning of 2008.",24.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A richly perfumed wine, with delicious flavors of raisins, dried plums and sweet tannins. It is an opulent wine, the acidity keeping a watchful eye over the ripeness. It is ready to drink now.",25.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A smooth wine that softens well, but that still retains rich fruits and dense, dusty tannins. There is good power here, from blackberry and red plums, the texture of velour. Drink now and over the next 3–4 years.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A fat, full wine, polished by its fresh herbal flavors. There are clean, lime and citrus tastes, a ripe spice and a crisp, green plum aftertaste.",15.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"An intensely grassy wine, with green fruit and herb flavors, structured and laced with yeast from the lees. It has a hard edge from its straight-laced structure; it needs food.",20.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Snappy citrus and a crushed stone minerality complement the light, lean structure of the wine. Definitely designed for easy drinking, this would be a deft pairing with fried seafood, having no problem lifting oily textures off your palate.",20.00,Alsace,Riesling
"A solid wine with plenty of lime, grapefruit and dusty mineral notes on both the nose and palate. Medium weight and a clean, fresh finish make this a good choice for lighter fare.",14.00,Alsace,Riesling
"A dense wine, with strong elements of its wood aging still prominent, and smoothing out the tannins. It has power, a dark texture and superripe almost jammy fruits. The final has mint, spice and sweet plum juice.",16.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A serious, intense wine, a success for the vintage, with its dusty tannins, solid blackberry fruits and a firm core. The wine is weighty, maybe just giving a green pepper hint, but generally sitting foursquare in the mouth.",30.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The wood element is powerful here, giving a smooth, polished character to the otherwise tightly knit fruit. Flavors of bitter coffee, spice and barbecued meats are there, with the juicy acidity and a dense texture. The wine needs another year to come together.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A fascinating—and unusual—blend of Sauvignon Gris and Sémillon, this wine is full of ripe, seriously opulent fruit, with peach and mango dominant. It is fleshed out with intense perfumes, rich fruit skins and kiwi fruit freshness.",15.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Muted flavors of green apple and lime pith are the only expressions of fruit in this medium-weight selection. Riding on the aromas of petrol and earthy minerality with a short fleeting finish, you're left with a desire formore.",15.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Floral notes of rose hips and hibiscus dominate this wine along with essences of petrol and white gumdrop. Off-dry and oily, flavors of sweet stewed peaches and spiced applesauce abound on the palate. Given the weight and viscosity, crisper acidity is needed to liven things up.",18.00,Alsace,Riesling
"A solid, ripe wine, with tannins to match the juicy black currants. The structure is flexible, pushing comfortably at the fruit. There is a bright character here, helped by the richness of the flavors.",35.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Crisp, clean and herbaceous, with grapefruit and citrus flavors. It's a light wine, with good acidity, grassy aromas and the scents of summer flowers.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A bit flat and lifeless with a bouquet composed only of petrol and stone. A touch of honey might present itself to some, but the fruit character is sorely missed.",12.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Vegetal notes and flinty chalk dominate the nose, while essences of green apple and lemon struggle to overcome the intrinsic greenness. The short finish gives no justice to the lush, creamy texture.",16.00,Alsace,Riesling
"A densely textured wine, but one with the weight of fruit to sustain the dry core. It is sold, chunky, pulling black berry fruits and plum skins into a good mélange of flavors. It will soften, but will always remain on the firm side. Age for 3–4 years.",30.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Good firm tannins, with ripe blackberry jam flavors, are followed by some spice from wood. This is a well-structured wine, its elements in place. The dry edge is finally dominant, and it probably needs 2–3 years aging.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Aromatic and zingy, this off-dry Riesling is easy to like, with aromas of spiced pear, mandarin orange and grapefruit peel that lead into a full-bodied and flavorful palate. There's lemon and toffee in the mouth that fade to a delicious honey and caramel aftertaste. At five years old, this wine has reached its peak and should be enjoyed the next year. Best served on its own.",40.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Stately and developed, with caramel aromas that fold in to a luxurious texture punctuated with notes of apple, pear and persimmon. Long, flavorful finish. Drink now.",47.00,Alsace,Riesling
"A dense, elegant wine, the berry fruits full of juice and fresh plums. The layer of tannins is firm, a clenched fist in the heart of the softer, riper fruit flavors. There is final fruit gum acidity.",19.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The wood gives a spicy aroma, and the palate has an attractive touch of ginger to go with the pink grapefruit and green plum flavors. A soft wine that has toast as well as ripe acidity.",24.00,Bordeaux,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Gorgeously nuanced nose, with almond, marzipan, melon, lime and fresia up front, set against a palate of Brazil nut and cinnamon toast. Soft and lush, the long finish picks up a nutmeg accent. Noticeable sweetness suggests this wine will work well as an apéritif. Drink now for its freshness or cellar a few years for more complexity.",35.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"Just off-dry, with intense flower and stone fruit aromas and a silky, decadent texture. The finish of white cherries, fig and lemon goes on and on. Drink now for its lovely, youthful fruit or stash it for a few years for more complexity.",30.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"A firm, spicy wine, its fruit and tannins showing the character of the vintage, but also with some weight. The tannins are dense rather than hard and the berry fruits are juicy, but manage to keep high acidity at bay. A success.",25.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Soft, dusty tannins balance a wine that is full of the ripest fruit. It has power, but gentle power, with rounded corners and a texture that is dense, never hard. The fruits are ripe plums, perhaps lacking final freshness.",35.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This powerful white has an intriguing nose of toasted almonds, spiced orange and almond cookies while the mouth is an explosion of intense nut, cinnamon and honey, set against a noticeable level of residual sugar. A good wine to savor on its own. Drink over the next three to four years.",40.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"Based in the heart of the Entre-deux-Mers, this vineyard has ancient monastic origins. The 2005 is a well-balanced wine, structured with Cabernet and rounded with Merlot. The fruit is rich, not complex, but very food friendly.",14.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Cool, calm wine, its fruit and tannins kept nicely in check. There is a classic feel here, square and elegant. The berry fruits are bright, with a spurt of sweet and sour acidity. Age for 3–4 years.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"With 14 months' new wood aging, this wine is still all wood and toast. The wine does have weight, with the promise of blackberry fruits under the firm tannins. It is finely structured and should mature well.",18.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A solid, chunky wine, with a structure that is full of corners and edges. The tannins are in a dusty, chewy style, balancing with the fresh black fig and sweet plum juice flavors. Rich and concentrated, the wine needs to age.",28.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Striking a great balance between elegance and richness, this shows plenty of sweet fruit, white peaches and quince, while also keeping poise with  its structure and finishing acidity. This will be a great food Chardonnay.",50.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A very pretty wine, with intense aromatics of crushed flowers and passionfruit. The palate is flavorful, crisp and refreshing, winding up with a tangy, citrus-accented finish. Serve with light fish preparations.",24.00,Alsace,Riesling
"The alcohol certainly gives the wine richness, but it manages to sustain it well, with superripe black plum and damson flavors, dusty tannins and a powerful texture that rolls richly around the mouth. It leaves a sweet and juicy aftertaste like old-style Rioja.",30.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Ripe and opulent, offering up a lovely cornucopia of rose, cardamon, nutmeg and faded flower tones that slide into a luxuriously textured palate with spice and quince accents. Try with an onion tart. Best now to 2011.",20.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"Spicy, soft wine, full of sweet juicy fruit, the wood element more of feeling of roundness than taste. The wine has fresh blackberry fruits and a gentle core of tobacco and tannin.",24.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This wine opens with an explosion of Granny Smith apples underlined by firm minerality. The honeyed palate shows nice grapefruit and lemon character. Medium, citrus finish. Best now, but will gain complexity over three to four years.",30.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"A timid wine, with cheese, strawberry and lime scents followed by a crisp palate of nectarines, petroleum and white flowers. The medium, peachy finish is slightly off-dry. Drink now or hold several years for more aromatic development.",45.00,Alsace,Riesling
"A selection of the best cuvées creates a wine that has some weight and density, although the extreme juiciness gives fresh black currant flavors. The tannins are present, but soft.",16.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Unusually oxidative in style but concentrated, with a luxurious texture and flavors of apple skin and baked apples. Medium, crisp finish. Drink now.",51.00,Alsace,Riesling
"The mineral expression has the upper hand in this dry, full-bodied white, with tones of apple and nuts playing second fiddle to cinnamon and wet stone flavors. The long finish winds up on a nutmeg note. Drink now.",35.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"Made from grapes sourced from a single vineyard, this is an intensely minerally Champagne. It is dry and austere, with citrus fruits dominant. The wine needs to age to bring out all of the richness and toast flavor, but it will always be a structured Champagne. This is very much a food wine.",65.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Redde's top wine, named after the winery, is rounded, rich and full in the mouth. Flavors of toast and ripe pear combine with tangy acidity, producing a complex, intensely fruity wine that should age for two years.",27.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"This firmly tannic wine, characteristic of Saint-Estèphe, is very dry. Underneath the dryness, there is a delicious, opulent juiciness that brings out black currant and plum flavors. It's obviously a wine for the long haul; keep for at least six years.",23.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This is a rugged, firmly tannic rendering of Châteauneuf-du-Pape that requires time in the cellar to reach its full potential. That said, it may also pose a risk, because there are hints of Band-Aid on the nose and a slightly metallic edge to the finish that may worsen over time. The other flavors are potent and concentrated: plum, chocolate and licorice all leave lasting impressions on the palate. Try after 2016.",77.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Rich and juicy, this features a ripe plum flavor and acidity, resulting in a wine that is fragrant, fresh and structured. It has power, and its dark concentration is at the heart of this solid effort.",140.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This wine starts with a shock of acidity, followed by a ripe blackberry note. It is upright, structured and still young, and its sweetness is just beginning to show through the tannins and acidity. Give it 3–4 years.",38.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Blin's nonvintage cuvée is a blend of Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay, producing a rich, soft feeling. Its acidity is deliciously balanced by the ripe apple and pineapple notes. Ready to drink, it is an apéritif-style offering.",40.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend

"There's heavy wood here, a powerhouse of toast. The fruit is subdued at this young stage, but is here, so give this ripe and potentially juicy wine time to integrate.",26.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This mint- and new-wood-flavored wine boasts ripe tannins and lush fruit. It feels weighty, perhaps almost too rich, while the tannins have a bitter-chocolate edge to them.",25.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Full bodied, structured and tannic while also fruity, this is fine example of the 2010 vintage. It's all structure at this stage, but it's going to be a full and ripe wine, although the alcohol does show through at the end in a pepper-driven moment.",22.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Always a popular vineyard, Beaune Grèves has produces a full, ripe, intense wine. It shows some signs of wood aging as well as rich strawberry and red plum. It's delicious already, but this full and complex wine deserves aging. Drink now –2025.",40.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir

"This big, ripe and fruity wine shows both the richness and the structure of the vintage, but never loses sight of balance. It's full of rich yellow fruits, green plums and citrus, but structured with refreshing acidity, a minerally texture and gentle hints of wood aging. Drink from 2015.",66.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Rounded ripe wine, showing some softness from its dosage as well as creamy pear and quince fruit flavors. It's bright and fresh at the end, and attractive to drink now.",15.00,Alsace,Sparkling_Blend
"Very soft while also full-bodied, this wine has a spicy character and only light acidity. It's a warm wine, open and completely ready to drink.",17.00,Alsace,Pinot_Auxerrois
"In fact a Blanc de Blancs—although the label doesn't indicate it—this is a nervy, steely wine, packed tight with apple and pink grapefruit flavors and bright acidity to finish.",22.00,Alsace,Chardonnay
"Fresh and crisp, this is a lively tangy wine, its citrus element nicely dovetailed with its apple and white fruit flavors. A hint of pepper adds piquancy.",20.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"A simple, spicy wine, it is rounded and creamy. It tastes of pepper and lychee fruits, with a soft, full character. The richness is well balanced with the acidity. A wine that can be drunk now.",27.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris

"This blend of Marsanne and Roussanne comes across as something of a hybrid between Hermitage and Burgundy. It has grilled peach, citrus and smoke notes, ample weight and a long, hazelnut-tinged finish. Drink it over the next 6–8 years.",42.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"An oak-aged cuvée, this wine nevertheless exhibits tremendous fruit. An aroma of brandied black cherry leads the way along with hints of cinnamon and menthol, picking up notes of vanilla and cedar on the palate. This big wine boasts a velvety texture and plenty of finesse, although the cedary note stands a little apart on the finish. Give it another 2–3 years of cellaring.",96.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This ripe, full-bodied offering has a soft feeling due to its rich dosage. It features apple and ripe pear flavors, with a shaft of acidity that creates a crisp, fresh aftertaste.",70.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend

Drink from 2017.",65.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend

"From the legendary 1996 vintage, this is a bottling that only received its dosage in 2012. It is very dry, intensely crisp and packed with acidity and minerality. Still young and fruity, it's an impressive wine that will certainly improve with age. Drink through 2022.",275.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend

"Schlumberger's practice of aging wine before release means that this is a Riesling well on the way to impressive maturity. It is poised, with an aroma of currant and hints of toast and flower. While drinkable now, this would certainly be worth aging for several more years.",32.00,Alsace,Riesling
"A powerful evocation of the weight of a Gevrey-Chambertin Grand Cru, this wine shows as much tannin as fruit. That said, the potential for the two coming into balance, aided by the edge of toast, is superb and worth waiting at least six years.",236.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir

"Fragrant and perfumed, this has a smoky character and crisp fruit, while remaining attractively ripe. The tannins are soft, and the acidity on the finish is fruity.",20.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Full, rich and fat, this is classic, ripe yellow fruit-flavored Meursault with good acidity. A finely balanced, wood-aged wine with good concentration from the lees stirring during fermentation.",29.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Made of 50% Carignan, 25% Syrah and 25% Grenache, there's a touch of acetone in the nose here but it's countered by notes of black fruit, small wild berries and garrigue herbs. Still tightly wound with firm tannins and assertive acidity, the mouth is rich and fruity, exhibiting strong cherry and berry flavors.",35.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This dark red blend of 40% Syrah, 30% Grenache and 30% Mourvèdre is all muscle and hard to refuse. Intense black cherry, boysenberry, game, violet and licorice all contribute to this big, tightly structured wine. The long finish is like a journey all on its own, evolving from jammy fruit to peppery spice and finally waxy dark chocolate. Drink now–2014.",20.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Full, ripe and rounded, this wine has the warmth of 2009, giving a Chablis with a richer texture than usual. It brings out the wood, spice and melon characters. It needs a year or two aging to get it at its best.",33.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A very dense wine, packed with red fruits, showing ripe concentration. There is an underlying toast and spice character to balance the sweet fruit. The weight is there now, the richness will come later.",29.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"There is a good amount of the square, chunky Nuits Saint-Georges feel to this wine. Manuel Olivier is based in the town, so should know his stuff, and has blended a solid, firm wine, with a dark edge of tannins, balanced by acid freshness.",39.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A complex, wood-aged wine, full in the mouth, balancing well between toast and sweet melon and apple flavors, spiked with grapefruit acidity. It would be worth aging for 2–3 years.",40.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is a lush and satisfying Rivesaltes Ambré, made from 100% White Grenache and aged in oak for seven years. There's a gorgeous rancio quality to the wine with notes of almond and orange rind throughout, framed by aromas and flavors of quince paste, wood-grilled peach, fruit cake and carmelized date. The long finish shows good evolution, transitioning from notes of stone fruit to peach pit and finally ending on a sweet spice accent.",36.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Grenache_Blanc
"This is a surprisingly reticent wine, with a forward spicy character that translates into a more elegant, rounded wine. The acidity and firm structure help to texture the lychee flavor. Pair this with food.",60.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"Warm, rounded and full bodied, this has flavors of yellow fruit, apple and pear notes, with a touch of attractive wood spice. There is a fine burst of uplifting acidity on the finish.",34.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"While the surface of the wine is firmly tannic, the fruit brings in the richness and opulence underneath. The combination equals a ripe, wood-aged wine, with dry tannins that are beginning to integrate into the fruit.",61.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Warm and ripe, this has yellow fruits that contrast with the freshness of crisp apples. There is a light touch of minerality, although the essence of the wine is its fruitiness.",22.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Soft, full and very rounded, this has yellow fruit flavors that are ripe and open, with its acidity emerging slowly. The finish is more focused and fresh.",30.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This shows good crispness, with an apple flavor and zesty acidity. The fruitiness is balanced by a mineral edge and a touch of caramel.",24.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is rich with flavors of yellow fruit and ripe pear. It has a good texture, with crisp, citrusy acidity that adds a lively edge to this ripe wine. While it's already drinkable, give this another six months of aging.",22.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Rich, deliciously fruity and ripe, this combines warmth with a more mineral undertow that cuts through the palate, creating a wine that is refreshing and mouth-filling. It would be worth aging for two years or more.",20.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"From Tramier's own vineyards, this is a soft, fleshy wine with a light touch. The tannins are already gentle and the red berry fruits are highlighted by crisp acidity. For short-term aging only.",35.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Lacks the precise focus and mineral lift of the '07, but still offers a satisfying mouthful of pear and pineapple fruit. Soft and a bit broad but tasty.",35.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"A showy, aromatic white, the '07 Côté Jardin features assertive notes of orange zest and anise around a core of wet stones. It's full bodied without being blowsy, but should be consumed over the near term.",14.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"This blend of Grenache Blanc and Vermentino offers slightly floral aromas that hint at apricot or peach, then follows those up with similar flavors and just a touch of spice on the finish. Marrenon is emerging as a dependable source for value wines from the Luberon.",13.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"Initially a fresh, fruity wine that only shows a streak of tannins and dryness. Pure Merlot, it has generosity, even if remaining light and fresh. There is a final pure line of acidity and berry fruits.",35.00,Bordeaux,Merlot
"Showing, coffee and sweet juicy fruit, the wine has a light touch, freshened with acidity and strengthened lightly with tannins. There is a meaty character, but the wine does finish a little hollow.",75.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A wine on the lean side, relatively light, with tannins tight and firm. It has some initial easy berry flavors, but they are followed by a dry aftertaste.",25.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Comes out of the bottle with a slightly smoky, struck-match aroma, then settles down into melon and pear tinged with anise. It's full bodied, but not long or intense enough on the finish to warrant a higher rating.",29.00,Rhône_Valley,Marsanne
"Pretty and delicately spicy, with notes of dried fruit and Asian pear. There's a core of bright acidity here, noticeable despite the high level of residual sugar, that makes for a refreshing finish. A great choice for Dim Sum.",48.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"Rich, sweet, flowery and deliciously blowsy, with spice, ginger, lychees and melons. The wine is a powerhouse of richness, the acidity a sideshow. Ready to drink now.",73.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"Sweet and perfumed, but with a sense of proportion despite its alcohol. It has fine ripe fruits, star fruit and mango prominent, while the acidity keeps the exuberance in check. The final flavor brings in fresh white fruits. For aging 4–5 years.",20.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"With a wine from every cru in Chablis, La Chablisienne is able to bring out the character of each. This cool Côte de Léchet is typical in its tight, mineral character, revealing its edgy nature. It's a wine with some aging potential, so give it 2–3 years and more.",31.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Mont de Milieu is a popular Chablis Premier Cru, deliciously soft and ripe, only lightly mineral. It does have a fine streak of acidity that propels it along to a zingy green plum finish.",34.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Kirsch, black currant, cured meat and foliage notes lead the way on this concentrated, tightly structured wine. Dried black cherry and fresh garrigue herbs fill the velvety textured mouth, and linger well into the finish alongside a touch of cocoa powder flavor. Drink now through 2014.",25.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah-Grenache
"A mineral-textured wine that balances a tight steely core against a richer buttery exterior. There is great fruit here, fresh grapefruit and lime zest going well with creamier apples. Age for 2–3 years.",37.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Soft, ripe quince and pear flavors are lifted by the presence of pink grapefruit. The wine has weight as well, the ripe Sauvignon blossoming in the glass. It's crisp, while also having a rounder profile.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Aged in acacia wood barrels, which give less wood flavor than oak, this is an attractive, lightly oxidized wine with a toasty edge, very dry with almond and honeyed fruit flavors.",16.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"A structured, crisp and mineral-driven wine, this merely hints at raspberry flavors but is dedicated to a steely character. That suggests youth, and the wine, with its tense texture, could well age over several more years. For now, this is an impressive wine that demands pairing with food.",72.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Prominent notes of stewed red berries along with compost and cola. With a simple, light body and moderate finish, this would be a good choice to pair with flavorful marinated chicken dishes.",13.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Pinot_Noir
"With all of its firm tannins intact, this is a solid, dense and concentrated wine. Black fruits linger behind the dark structure. Age this powerful wine for 4–5 years.",126.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This is concentrated, with big, firm tannins that are still covering the red berry fruits. It is always going to be firm and dry, although the aggressive tannins should open up to show more fruit after another two years.",140.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A wine that combines juicy acids, firm tannins and attractive fruit flavors. This is well banaced with a mineral character and taut structure. This should be ready to drink in 2–3 years.",36.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Taut, tannic and nervy, this has red currant fruit that gives a crisp sensation to this tight, precise wine. Give it a year to soften.",26.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Round and rich, this has delicious acidity and touches of tropical fruits. It's ripe and full bodied, with an attractive hint of wood.",18.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Attractively ripe, this has fruity red-berry flavors along with acidity and soft tannins. This is ready to drink now.",17.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Exhibiting the roundness of the vintage, this is rich and soft. With notes of almond, yeast and yellow fruit, this is already maturing into a bold, open wine. Ready to drink.",35.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Dominated by toasty, mentholly oak, this is a dark, vibrant purple-hued wine that features plenty of intensity, just not a lot of midpalate richness or complexity. Could improve over time, or could fall apart, so opt to drink it on the young side just in case.",80.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Very pure fruit, crisp, a tight mineral band over vivid flavors. Tensely structured, this has a light vanilla character, packed with fruit skins, crisp and citrus.",25.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Steely, crisp, with a tight edge of green fruits. The structure is dominant at this stage in the development of this rapier-like wine. Age for 3–4 years.",18.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Sparkling Vouvray, full of rich fruit, with layers of almonds, toasted bread and intense acidity. It is a tangy wine, with an apple skin texture over a light creamy mousse.",25.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc

"A delicious Volnay, all warm fruits and sweet tannins. The wine is soft as well as juicy, enjoying ripe cherry and red plum juice flavors. The tannins and acidity give a gentle boost. Drink now, or age for 3–4 years.",45.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A finely balanced wine, preserving the mineral edge and keeping fine acidity while displaying  ripe white and yellow fruits.",35.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Swathes of dry fruits, white currants, herbs and almonds make this a classic young Chenin Blanc from Vouvray. It is fresh, tight, lined with acidity. Drink now, or age 4–5 years.",16.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Firmly tannic, solid and chunky wine. The ripe strawberry flavors are balanced by firm tannins and a dark edge of plum skins. Should be aged for another year.",59.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Full-bodied wine, rich and rounded. It has its edge of tannins underlying the ripe cherry fruits. There is a jammy character that seems to diminish any acidity, making this a wine for drinking soon.",49.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This retains so much freshness, with just a hint of toast showing at the back of a wine that otherwise projects minerality, a tight structure and intense citrus acidity. It should be aged for several more years.",55.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Roederer takes the natural elegance of a blanc de blancs to an extra level. This is so stylish, its white fruit and lemon flavors are touched with the minerality, and the acidity is nearly absorbed into the texture of the wine. Like many Roederer vintages on release, this should be aged, so give it 4–5 years.",78.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Green and vegetal with green pepper, asparagus, and mushy black plum skins thoughout the nose and palate. The mouth is round with soft tannins and low acidity.",13.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot
"Here is a light, fairly acidic Syrah that's good for heartier fare on warmer days. The light mouth is loaded with fresh red plum, lively berry flavors and a hint of thin mint.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
"A touch medicinal and candied; smells like red Jolly Rancher, mashed black plum guts and cherries. Simple but drinkable with a lighter weight and decent finish.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot
This is well aged and attractively packaged with its ripe fruits and more mature almond and yeast flavors. The wine has good intensity to go with its taut and tangy character. Drink over the next 2–3 years.,53.00,Alsace,Riesling
"With its gold color, this looks like an opulent wine—a fact confirmed on the palate. It remains essentially dry; its opulence translated into great swathes of perfumed tropical fruits. It has weight, the sort of wine to go with rich sauces—or even by itself.",50.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"Soft and rounded, this is a ripe, full-bodied wine. It has pear and peach fruits, laced with lime-like acidity and notes of almond and yeast. With its bright, crisp finish, it's a wine to age over the next two years.",21.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is warm and round, with red fruit flavors that are attractively displayed against a backdrop of soft tannins. The acidity lends crispness, highlighting the ripe fruit on the finish.",19.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"From the Vincent family of Château de Fuissé, this is a ripe wine, with its green plum and nectarine fruits giving it roundness. At the same time, there is a bright, attractive edge of crispness, with a citrusy finish.",25.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"The global brand Oriel tapped Louis Barruol of Saint-Cosme to craft this Châteauneuf from 70% Grenache and 30% Mourvèdre, and the result is a slightly austere, leathery wine only slightly rounded out by chocolaty fruit. Give it a few years to come around.",35.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A tight wine, the tannins almost too much for the fresh but lightweight fruits. The wood element is poised to soften the edges of the acidity and black currant fruits, but it needs another six months. The aftertaste is dominated by soft Merlot.",26.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Decant this wine to help lessen the burnt match aroma that mars the nose initially. Once past that annoyance, this is a broad, very drinkable wine that blends pineapple notes with touches of honey, spice and alcoholic warmth. Drink now.",39.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"This crisp wine has bright fruits, lively acidity and a vibrant mineral character. It could develop for another 1–2 years.",33.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Toasty wine, maybe over-toasty, giving a buttery malolactic feel. Its acidity and its freshness are both enveloped in a more opulent embrace.",30.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Based on Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Aligoté and Gamay, this is a typical light, creamy and frothy Crémant. It has lively pear and red apple juice flavors, with great crisp acidity.",15.00,Burgundy,Sparkling_Blend
"This ripe, full, almost toasty wine tastes of tropical fruit and spice, giving it an exotic feel. At the same time, the right amount of acidity acts as a fine balance. This concentrated wine, medium-sweet in style, should be aged for 2–3 years.",33.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"Berry fruits lie as a layer of fruit over licorice and bitter tannins. The wine has a fresh spring character, but is too light for its own good. Best drunk chilled.",12.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"The freshest, lightest Beaujolais, with flavors of red currants, bitter cherries and very tight, crisp acidity. A touch of banana comes through to finish.",10.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"Juicy, with hints of banana, this a bright wine, all open red fruits, totally fresh from acidity. Ready for drinking, lightly chilled.",15.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"The Gravières vineVard is Premier Cru for both white and red. This white version is currently dominated by a new wood aroma and a sweet toast flavor. It's full, soft and rounded, with flavors of creamed pears and ripe peaches.",45.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Firm, tense and structured, this has weight and richness, with notes of quince and green plums, lending ripeness and acidity.",25.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is fruity, with a hint of the vintage's crisp minerality. It has citrus and apple flavors, with a touch of toast. Ready to drink in a year.",28.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is a light wine with tropical fruit flavors. The acidity and notes of almond and white fruit add to its rounded, ready-to-drink feel.",16.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Full, ripe and creamy, this rolls mellifluously around the palate. Pear and plum flavors dominate along with the crisp edge of lime. The finish is just as rich and smooth.",18.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Firm and structured, this has strong tannins set over smoky fruit. It has concentration, although the wood flavor has an old-wood feel, seeming just a touch dirty.",63.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"The blend is 60% Roussanne, 40% Marsanne, apparently barrel-fermented and aged, as the toast, smoke and coffee elements dominate the nose and palate. There's enough fruit concentration to support the oak in a honeyed, mealy way that shows off the wine's breadth and texture. Drink now.",13.00,Rhône_Valley,White_Blend
"An unusual blend of 80% Clairette and 20% Bourboulenc, this medium-bodied wine is crisp and citrusy, marked by pineapple and hints of underripe peach and pear. It's light enough to be paired with more delicate seafood dishes over the summer months.",11.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"This wine is a bit on the lean side compared to most southern Rhône whites, but the plus side to that is its freshnesss and vivacity. Pear fruit is underlined by hints of spice, finishing clean and crisp. Drink now.",11.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"While Colombo's Les Abeilles is a more traditional Rhône blend, this offering marries 70% Viognier with 30% Roussanne. The result is a medium-bodied wine hinting at honeyed peaches and tinged with anise that seems to be on a fast-developing course. Drink it over the next several months.",17.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"An easy, soft style of Merlot, with spicy red berry fruits topped by wood. The tannins are light, the fruit deliciously fresh, finishing with refreshing acidity.",22.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Lean and austere, this is a tannic wine, with medicinal aromas, spice, stalky currant fruit flavors and tight texture.",27.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Kreydenweiss' unusually oxidative vinification methods are better suited to making a sweet wine such as this Vendanges Tardives, where we expect more savory flavors and less fresh fruit. The dominant notes here are caramel, cider and Asian spices, supported by a bright line of acidity that carries the flavors through to the lingering finish. Drink now.",103.00,Alsace,Riesling
"A good value in the world of Zind-Humbrecht wines, this off-dry Gewürztraminer is super-concentrated, with a silky texture and flavors of lychees and cling peaches. A nice white cherry accent kicks in on the medium finish. Try with Thai fare.",48.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"An understated choice for those who wish Gewürztraminer were a more subtle wine. The nose is a bit shy with a delicate floral tone, though the palate has good flavor intensity with punchy notes of Chinese spices and honeycomb resting on a texture that is lazy, soft and a bit sweet. Try on its own after dinner.",65.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"An interesting blend of 50% Bourboulenc, 17% Roussanne, 17% Vermentino and 16% Grenache blanc, this is a different kind of white with great complexity. The only thing holding this wine back is a thin mouthfeel, but the aromas of fresh thyme, orange, Asian pear and a touch of honey are undoubtedly enticing, and the well-balanced fruit-forward palate is delish.",29.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"Dry in character, touched by acidity, this is a raspberry- flavored wine, with a squeeze of lemon. The wine is full, but crisply dry.",30.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"Full-bodied wine, but with an edge of fresh grapefruit flavor and bright acidity. This estate Muscadet balances ripeness with classic Muscadet lightness.",12.00,Loire_Valley,Melon
"Rounded and soft, very approachable. It has attractive raspberry fruit and lively acidity, while the structure evolves slowly to show the dry edge of tannins and smoky aftertaste. For drinking now and over 4–5 years.",35.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Ripe yet crisp, this is a fine reflection of the excellent 2004 vintage in Champagne. It has a rich texture with concentrated apple, pineapple and toast notes, along with a tangy orange-zest character. Ready to drink now, but it will certainly age.",79.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"From the family-owned J. Dumangin, this is a full, fruity, ripe wine that's full of sweet apple and lime flavors, with a bright orange-zest texture. It's also more serious than this fruitiness suggests, with dense flavor and concentration that promises to age.",53.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Red berry preserves, watermelon and raspberry dominate the nose, while flavors of strawberry hull and toast come through in the mouth. Light weight with a short finish.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Pinot_Noir
"With a light brick color and thin mouthfeel, this wine seems to be past its prime. The mild nose offers nuances of small tart berries, rhubarb and a hint of pepper. The palate shows more of the same, with flavors of red currant and strawberry hull.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"As the name suggests, there are notes of crushed violets to be discovered among flavors of small red berries, strawberry and subtle black pepper. The mouth is lightweight with strong acidity, closing with a short finish.",12.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
"Full of juicy red-fruit flavors, this is hugely rich. It is solid, chunky and concentrated, with jammy red-plum flavors marrying with firm tannins and intense acids. Expect this wine to age for six-plus years.",40.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This is firm, with smoky tannins and sweet berry fruits. It is rich; the densely structured, dry core and the acidity promise ageability. The finish is ripe and full bodied.",71.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This is fruity, with some structure and pure acidity. It's fragrant and delicious now, bearing raspberry fruit and a light texture.",25.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
This is delicate and crisply fruity. Its acidity and citrus presence offer a fragrant character that contrasts nicely with the more creamy texture.,20.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This has soft red fruits along with a firm structure of tannins and acids. Shapely and balanced, this is ready to drink now.",22.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This is a fresh, fruit-driven white loaded with pineapple and pear aromas and flavors. It's medium bodied, making it suitable for pairing with a wide array of dishes, and finishes crisp and clean.",13.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"Remember those vaguely anise-like white gumdrops? That describes the aromas and flavors found in the 2006 Les Sinards, albeit without the sugar. It's a medium- to full-bodied largely neutral white that should be consumed over the next year or two.",39.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"A wood-dominated wine, all the dryness coming from barrels rather than fruit. Will it broaden out? It's hard to find the fruit at the moment, but there is weight under the wood, so perhaps.",15.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Of the many Mas du Soleilla offerings, this one is the lightest of the bunch with bright and lively notes of cherry Jell-O, sweet strawberry and a touch of fresh thyme. The tannins are light but there, with accents of waxy clove and weak coffee on the close. Drink now.",29.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Lightly laced with wood, this attractive ripe wine shows pear and peach flavors and vivid acidity. It is well textured, with a streak of apple and pear skins. Fine grained wine, with attractive final acidity.",25.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Herbaceous and with an extra ripeness from the fine summer of 2009, this is a deliciously smooth wine, the Sauvignon's natural acidity balanced by sweet apple juice over a greengage skin texture.",21.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A very pure wine, its red berry fruits dominating lively acidity as well as a tight, tannic, dry core.",24.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"Fresh and bright, dominated by its citrus and almond flavors. It has a soft, creamy texture, with highlights of orange zest, green plums and a great burst of acidity.",15.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"While there are plenty of firm tannins and weight here, the wine does feel somewhat hollow. The red fruits are there, showing slowly against the tannins. It has fine final acidity, but not the power and concentration you should expect.",100.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"An invitingly perfumed wine, its fruit bursting with citrus intensity. It has bright, very textured and mineral structure offering aging potential. There is a lively, vivid aftertaste.",50.00,Alsace,Riesling
"This striking Provence white opens with intense aromatics of mixed nuts and peach that set the stage for a powerful expression of crushed flowers and grass in the mouth. This is a refreshing wine, but weighty and warm; try with veal or light pork dishes. Drink now to 2011.",28.00,Provence,White_Blend
"Finely perfumed wine, with all the right crisp, steely character of Riesling. It has bright white fruit flavors, intense initial acidity that broadens out into a fine, complex wine. Worth aging 3–4 years.",20.00,Alsace,Riesling
"An aroma of pure lychee announces a wine that is attractively balanced. It wears its richness easily; it's ripe and fruity, with a good level of acidity. With a medium-sweet character, it is a great wine for Asian cuisine.",40.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"There is plenty of character in this attractive wine. It has a fine balance between the rich natural spice of the Gewürztraminer and a fresh, citrus-driven edge, giving it a fine, textured character, worth aging a year.",22.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"This is a really fragrant wine, with white hedgerow flowers that introduce its rich, full body. It has just a touch of sweetness from the ripe pear and quince flavors, although the texture also has a fine edge of minerality. Age for another 1–2 years.",35.00,Alsace,Riesling
"This biodynamic Muscat is direct and focused, with a ripe core of stone fruit, melon rind and sweet citrus notes, framed by touches of waxy honeycomb, white flower and soft baking spice. A hint of toast lingers on the long finish, and the mouthfeel is full and lush without feeling viscious, thanks to the vibrant acidity.",45.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Muscat
The aromas are a touch on the funky side with notes of mushy compost pile and rotting cherries. The mouth shows more sour red fruit and rhubarb flavors. Decent if you don't mind strong leafy/foliage characteristics.,13.00,France_Other,Pinot_Noir
"Smells quite sweet and linear, with cotton candy, red Jolly Rancher and candied apple odors. The mouth is lean and tart with rhubarb and red currant overwhelming the palate.",11.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Pinot_Noir
"Starts off with notes of root beer, red cherry and raspberry. The palate shows tarter flavors of rhubarb and red currant with sanguine hints. Light weight in the mouth with a short, somewhat sour finish.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Pinot_Noir

"This is ripe and lined with solid, dry tannins, bearing strawberry, red plum and damson flavors. The wine has a rich spice note, a touch of smoke and a warm, soft finish.",38.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A ripely soft wine, although at this stage the wood is too obvous, lending a spice note that covers the rounded red fruits. It certainly demands at least five years of aging.",125.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This is powerful, showing concentration and firm tannins. It has a juicy element of red fruit and dark plum flavors. The smoky character from the wood adds an exotic touch.",55.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"The attractive smoky flavor and red berry fruits come through strongly in this wine. It has some weight, with a wood flavor supporting the fruitiness and the dense core of tannins. It's worth aging 2–3 years.",50.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Light and fruity, this has a yeasty edge along with acidity. On the palate, there are lots of green fruits, offering a dancing, lively character. At the end, there is a touch of vanilla.",30.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"With the extra concentration from the low-yielding old vines, this is a dense wine, with its acidity contrasting the rich red fruit. It is round and smooth, with well-integrated tannins and a soft, fruity finish.",24.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Still tannic, this is a minerally wine that's driven by red currant fruit. Its acidity is also an important element. It has the potential to round out and fill out over the next 2–3 years.",30.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Taut and textured, yet ripe and soft, this has a nectarine flavor that's balanced by a note of fresh lime. The finish is easy, nervy and zingy.",14.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Balanced and brightly fruity, this is laden with acidity and a ripe apple flavor. With its touch of vanilla, this is full and crisply delicious. Ready to drink now.",23.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is a fresh, medium-bodied white with a touch of honeysuckle on the nose and straightforward flavors that hints of orange and peach. A touch of spice adds interest to the modest finish. Drink now.",37.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
Olive and espresso notes are backed by bright cherry fruit in this medium-bodied Syrah. It's a pleasant quaff that turns slightly dry on the finish; try it after 2011.,34.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Comes across as slightly tarry and rubbery, which distracts from the otherwise crisp citrus and melon flavors. Still, it's a pleasant, medium-bodied quaff.",15.00,Rhône_Valley,Viognier
"This is one of the largest volume production Chablis, and it sings. Minerality and acidity go well with the ripe fruits and fresh acidity, bright and packed with grapefruit edginess.",25.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A lightly perfumed wine, from a blend with a dominance of Sauvignon Blanc. Citrus, almonds and piercing acidity combine to give a bright, light, very dry wine.",16.00,Loire_Valley,White_Blend
"Pure Sauvignon Blanc, this is herbal while also crisp, very fruity, bright and lively. Gooseberry juice dominates this intense wine.",16.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Delicious, fruity rosé, and as befits the vintage, with some weight and richness as well. The red berry flavors are overlaid with caramel and cinnamon. Great final acidity.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Rosé
"A soft and deliciously jammy wine. It has immediately attractive ripe plum and berry fruits, layered with balancing acidity. The tannins sit well in the plump cushion of the wine. Not for aging.",29.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"There's a strong herbal presence in the bouquet of this wine (bay leaves, clover) that marries well with the red plum and dried raspberry flavors. The mouth is smooth and creamy with a touch of tobacco spice lingering on the close. Drink now–2012.",20.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"The aroma says honey, but the palate says dry. It is an attractive paradox that results in a ripe wine, full of pure white currant, star fruit and, yes, honey flavors. It is not a wine for long aging, but will keep for 2–4 years.",20.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Lightly wood-flavored wine, emphasizing also the ripe peach and quince flavors. There is a spicy touch, just a sprinkling of nutmeg, the wine ripe and full.",40.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A mix of fresh citrus and toasty wood work well together in this elegant wine. The texture is soft, rounded, finishing with a great dash of lime. This is sophisticated white Burgundy.",56.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Sweet, rich wine, powerful ripe pear and melon flavors spiced with ginger and an opulent full texture. The wine lets its perfumed character get away with itself, but it's exuberant for a moment.",50.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"Biodynamic since 1969, François Meyer's wines show great purity of fruit. This Gewürztraminer has balanced spice, mango and lychee flavor, structured into shape by a good touch of pear juice acidity.",22.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"Here's a Provence red to take seriously for its sophisticated nose of forest floor and wet stones set against a backdrop of brambly fruit. The palate is charming, nuanced and extracted, with grippy tannins and a final lingering note of sour drops. Drink now, with some barbecued sanglière (boar), if you have some on hand. If not, spare ribs will do nicely as well.",28.00,Provence,Red_Blend
"This has a touch of toast and a rich character. A creamed pear note mingles with lime-driven acidity and a delicious, warm tropical-fruit aftertaste.",60.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Though not indicated as such on its label, this is a sweet wine. It has spiced, ripe fruit flavors, notably pear, which are deliciously laced with honey and cinnamon notes. There is also a fine streak of lively acidity that keeps this very fresh.",23.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"This wine develops slowly in the mouth, providing a finely structured, rich and elegant character. There's a round white-fruit flavor that's shot through with taut acidity. With its tight finish, it could age a few more months.",16.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"Firmly tannic, this is a solid, chunky wine. It's full of dark plum, black currant and cherry flavors that fill out the firm, dry structure. Concentrated while also fruity, it's worth aging for a year.",14.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"A beautifully balanced wine, expressing a certain sweetness, this has a great line of acidity. It's full bodied, ripe and packed with spice and fruit, while remaining elegant and impressive.",35.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"A bit lean in the mouth and short on the finish, but there's some nice red fruit notes with accents of foliage and spice.",14.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah-Grenache
"At this stage, this is a taut, minerally wine that's dominated by tight acidity. Pears and green plums are the lead flavors, with a touch of wood and a zing of crispness on the finish. Age for two years to round it out.",23.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A full-bodied wine, this is packed with flavors of white fruit and citrus. The texture is soft, hinting at some sweetness. It feels weighty, packed with a fine concentration of fruit and toast. Give this rich wine at least three years.",28.00,Alsace,Riesling
"This feels old fashioned with its big, solid and dry tannins. This is very smoky and laden with wood; the fruit seems to be way behind the dark, firm structure. It's never going to be fruity—always firmly tannic.",400.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Firmly tannic, this is dark and dense, with a rich black-fruit flavor and a solid structure. The fruit is developing, and as it does so, it is bringing out the weight of the wine, layering ripeness on top of the dry texture. Age for 2–3 years.",34.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Light, fragrant, and structured, this shows a smoky flavor and refreshing red-berry fruit. It's lively and fruity, and the tannins are in the background.",16.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Soft and crisp, this is light in texture and very fragrant. It boasts intense strawberry flavors, with already well-integrated tannins and a smooth, easy finish.",24.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Ripe and round, this has attractive, rich fruit flavors of apple and apricot, along with a fine streak of juiciness and acidity that provides a fragrant finish.",20.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This has herb and wood aromas, leading to a palate that's structured, with a yeasty, toasty flavor and a green, herbal character. It is quite tight, and does need to age for at least two years.",56.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Soft, smooth and buttery, this is full of ripe tropical fruits and bright, citrusy acidity. Ready to drink.",19.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is fruity, with an apple flavor that's lifted by a lemon zest edge. It's warm with a rich, minerally tautness; a caramel note comes through on the finish.",18.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Full bodied, but perhaps stretched a little beyond its limits, as the flavors of marmalade and honey seem to have difficulty covering the alcohol and bare stones. Drink up.",18.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"Atypically dark in color, this brassy Châteauneuf blanc comes across as aromatically muted. Then it's very neutral in flavor, with ample breadth but lacking in richness and depth. It's something of a conundrum.",48.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"Balanced but very firm, with dominant tannins, here is a wine with an angular feel to it. The tannins give a meaty character as well as laying alongside the plum skin flavors. It is dry, with some definite acidity.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This is a disappointment. The wine is tart, stalky and, at the same time, light. It has an edge of green that suggests underripe fruit. Developing fast.",24.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Dominated by cantaloupe melon and honey, this is an off-dry wine, deliciously fresh, with a strong streak of acidity. It is ripe, with pure fruit flavors and a very crisp finish.",24.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Very fruity in character, in high tension, its acidity pushing through the mineral texture and ripe fruit.",29.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"White Rully is one of the unsung values of Burgundy. This soft, attractive ripe wine is a pleasure to drink. It has a buttery, toast character along with crisp acidity, delicious apricot fruit and a mouthwatering aftertaste.",20.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is undeniably a concentrated wine offering a complex set of very appealing aromas and flavors (singed grapefruit peel, honey, caramel). However, it is a bit out of balance at 15.5% alcohol and finishes shorter than one has a right to expect in this triple-digit price range. It's starting to show some development and will probably not improve, so best to drink up soon.",110.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"Attractively perfumed Riesling, its fresh acidity matched by white currant fruits and a tight edge of minerality. Good, crisp final brightness.",25.00,Alsace,Riesling
"This is a berry-scented, moderately full-bodied Provence rosé. It's ripe and round, with a soft, easy-to-drink style and a moderately long finish. Drink now.",18.00,Provence,Rosé
"Soft and smooth, showing almonds, a touch of toast, the fruit calm, showing slowly in the riper texture of the wine. Acidity comes through as a final bite.",19.00,Alsace,Riesling
"This is a mature, rich wine from an excellent vintage in Champagne. The wine has toast as well as lemon and grapefruit flavors, giving weight and complexity. Although this is ready to drink, it could probably age a few more years.",48.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Aged in glass demijohns for one year and oak tuns for nine, this is a mature selection that's ready to drink now, though it can certainly keep for many more years to come. A beautiful rancio characteristic leads, with aromas of walnut shell, orange oil and earthy spice fill the bouquet. Skin-driven fruit flavors of cherry and plum dominate the gripping palate, while the complex finish reveals accents of black tea, licorice root and baking spice.",30.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Grenache
"This is a structured wine, showing the firm tannins of a 2010 Beaujolais. Under the dry surface, the rich, juicy fruit is there, balanced with acidity, red fruit and a dense texture. Age for at least another year.",39.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"Nicely rounded in the mouth, this Merlot shows well defined varietally correct notes of mocha, cherries and tobacco. It's not overly soft, nor overly structured, but it finishes with enough crispness to ably partner burgers and the like.",9.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot
"A fruity, simple rosé, with bits of strawberry and melon balanced by a dry, chalky finish. Has enough weight to partner grilled meats. Drink now.",10.00,Bordeaux,Rosé
"This is a medium-bodied, slightly creamy-textured blend of 60% Sauvignon Blanc, 30% Sémillon and 10% Muscadelle. Passion fruit, orange and tropical fruit notes exhibit intensity, just turning a bit tinned on the finish.",10.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"A blend of 65% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Cabernet Franc, this is a medium-bodied Bordeaux for everyday drinking. The understated black cherry and cassis fruit does seem a bit lean, but that's the vintage. Tobacco notes mark the finish.",10.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This is a simple, moderately tannic Cab with plenty of cassis and earth elements. It finishes firm, with pleasant dark-fruit flavors but a touch short. Drink it over the next year or two.",9.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Cabernet_Sauvignon
"A rather chunky, extracted Pinot Noir, with plummy flavors that end on a dark, dusty note slightly reminscent of charcoal. It's a surprisingly satisfying Pinot for the price.",9.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Pinot_Noir
"Shows some pleasant pear and pineapple aromas before easing into flavors of pear, quince and anise. It's only medium in body, but shows a flush of warmth on the finish. Drink now.",9.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"Drouhin has the exclusivity on the Marquis de Laguiche domaine, which is producing great white wine. Here, minerality and citrus acidity are layered over beautifully judged wood. The wine is rich but crisp, white berries mingling with pears and a delicious finishing spice. Age for 5–6 years. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",114.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"For many, this vineyard offers the purest form of Pinot Noir, a seductive, opulent style, with rich fruits dominant, the powerful acidity deceptively sweet. Add to this a tight, firm, smoke-and-toast tannic structure, and this is not only a fine wine now, but one with long-term potential. Keep for at least six years.",380.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Powerful, opulent and rounded, this is a dense wine. Drouhin owns two parcels on the eastern edge of the slope of Clos de Vougeot, and the wine does show great rich swathes of plums, dry figs, chocolate and sweet jelly, balanced by firm tannins and bright, always rich acidity. An impressive wine.",205.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"The great Clos des Chênes has produced a finely structured wine. It offers both beautiful red fruits that spread luxuriously in the mouth, and a dark, solid core of dry tannins that promise aging. The balance is impeccable, just the right amount of fresh, juicy acidity adding its lift to the mix.",76.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A wine with some concentration and a full, fruity character, this balances a light structure with a generous, wood-laced fruit flavor. While it's drinkable now, this shows potential to age.",21.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is a juicy, lemon- and yellow-fruit-flavored wine. There's fine acidity, creating a wine with plenty of freshness and richness.",17.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Serious and structured, this has dark, smoky flavors, with red-fruit acidity. The wine has good potential, with its jammy fruit heart surrounded by tannins that will soften.",61.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Crisp and cool, this shows a vanilla flavor that softens the attractive tight, acidic fruit. It's light in texture, with a prominent tang of citrus.",24.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Soft and rounded, this is touched by a note of vanilla that adds extra openness. With its apple and pear flavors, this is an attractive, fruity wine; it's very forward, but it shows a note of Chablis steel in the background.",24.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Hard and unyielding for Viognier, with lemon and mineral elements that seem a bit out of character for the variety. Nevertheless, it's a crisp refreshing white for the summer.",30.00,France_Other,Viognier
"Restrained in style, with modest pear and honey notes tinged with a toasty, mealy edge. Shows some nice creaminess to the midpalate, then fades gradually on the finish. Drink now.",52.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"Enjoyably full bodied and creamy textured, this slightly chewy Châteauneuf would rate higher if not for its slightly pruny, raisiny fruit.",35.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Tight and tannic, this is a wine with as much structure as fruit. It has a dusty, austere quality, the fruit a light layer underneath. The high proportion of Petit Verdot in the blend gives color as well as those tannins.",32.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
Although this wine's nose is still going strong--filled with hints of honey and tangerine--the fruit on the palate is fading rapidly. Drink up.,39.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"The branded wine from Domaines Lapalu (owner of Château Patache d'Aux) is a soft, clean, black currant-flavored Cabernet. The tannins show a mineral, tight edge, but the wine is on the light side.",12.00,Bordeaux,Cabernet_Sauvignon
"Made from 100% Pinot Noir, this is a vividly crisp wine, tight, with strawberry flavors laced with intense acidity and a tangy, zesty edge. Lively, bright, with a fruity finish.",23.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A soft wine, its flavors initially out of focus. It develops slowly, showing rich flavors from the wood, the structure smothered in a soft cushion. It is perhaps too ample for its own good.",70.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Dark chocolate and rich plum sauce add complexity to this black fruit-driven Merlot. Blackberry preserves and soft plum guts fill the mouth, with a touch of green pepper appearing on the finish. Medium weight with a creamy texture and a medium-length finish. Drink now.",13.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot
"There's a strong herbal component to this wine, with assertive bay leaf and rosemary aromas among the standard dark fruit character. Medium weight in the mouth with structured tannins and a coffee-infused finish. Drink now.",13.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Cabernet_Sauvignon
"Here's a fruit forward and very drinkable red blend of 60% Syrah, 35% Mourvèdre and 5% Grenache. Jammy red berry preserves, boysenberry and blueberry all present themselves in the fleshy mouth, with a fruitcake spice lingering through the close.",21.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Here's a mineral-driven red with strong notes of black cherry and plum throughout the nose and mouth and a touch of dark chocolate on the close. Medium weight with firm tannins and medium acidity; 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Syrah and 10% Petit Verdot.",13.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Red_Blend
"Jessiaume is based in Santenay and the wine shows the attraction of this village at the southern end of the Côte de Beaune. It reveals soft fruit, warmed by a jammy layer of red berries and ripe acidity.",28.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A ripe wine, showing good concentration from old vines. Flavors are of black currant, red apples and tangy mandarin, the acidity intense and bright.",15.00,Burgundy,Aligoté
"Rounded and attractively soft, the wine has mouthwatering raspberry and almond flavors. It feels warm, even rich, with its layers of acidity enveloped by ripe fruits. A sparkling wine for food.",17.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"There is a great balance between the natural floral and perfumed character of this Gewürztraminer and its lively acidity. These elements combine to form a wine that is complex and immediately attractive. It's ready to drink, but it can also age for a year.",29.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"This is a brooding selection, with layers of dark fruits (think blackberry, plum and cherry), chewing tobacco and bay leaf alongside a hint of vanilla bean. The palate is rich and dense, with a texture like crushed satin. Tight and flavorful now, this would benefit from a bit more time in the cellar; try after 2015.",24.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Grenache
"The density of a great grand cru from Gevrey-Chambertin is all here, magnified by the concentration of dark fruits and the firmest tannins. A powerful wine, it doesn't lose sight of ripe fruits, layered acidity and an edgy tannic structure on the finish.",149.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A big, powerful wine that brings together dark tannins and dense fruit. The fruit flavors are ripe black plum buried within the concentrated dryness of the tannin. No question, this needs aging for all its burly potential to be realized.",285.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Puligny's tight, stony character shows well here, in a wine that has taut acidity, fresh pear and citrus flavors on a base of a strong wood and fruit skin texture. The acidity is of a piece with the rest of the wine, which is dominated by grapefruit and lime to the finish. An impressive wine that needs 3–4 years. Imported by Robert Kacher Imports.",95.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is rich, opulent Pinot Noir, its ripe strawberry, black cherry and sweet plums brimming out of the glass. The core of tannins, and smoky wood are more serious, offering aging potential. The wine is young, beautifully ripe, mouthfilling and hedonistic.",85.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Very mineral and structured, this is a wine that needs aging. The tannins at this stage are firm, dry, dense, forming a solid core. Around this floats the red cherry and red currant fruit flavors, just sweet and lifted by acidity, Give it at least five years.",75.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A firm, tightly balanced wine, the intense fruit fitting into a dry, solidly tannic framework. It is ripe, certainly, with a sweet, juicy character, but the dense structure is as important, a core of steely resolve to go with the delicious fruit and acidity. Demands 5–10 years and more aging.",145.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"The nose powers with wood and high toast aromas, but the palate reveals sufficient ripe pineapple and yellow fruit flavors to act as a balance. There is a prominent acidity that cuts through this richness. The wine certainly needs 3–4 years for the wood to soften and integrate better with the fruit, but then this will be a superb wine. Imported by Robert Kacher Imports.",102.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A wine with great substance, a rounded, lightly toasty character giving richness. It doesn't lose the freshness of Chablis, with the pear and green plum fruits lifted by a fine grapefruit and lime citrus character. Worth aging for 4–5 years, but already ready to drink. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd.",117.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Hinting at opulence to come, this is a rich wine. Its tannins are powerful but do not detract from the ripe berry and stone fruits. It has a fine, balanced texture with the sweetness of the fruit lifted by delicious acidity. Give this wine five years at least.",156.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A big, bold wine, its fruits etched richly against the ripe tannins and spice. The sweet fig and plum flavors are balanced well with the refreshing raspberry juice acidity. A fine, dark wine that will age for several years.",256.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This is opulent Meursault at its best, all rounded corners, a padded texture and toast mingling easily with yellow fruits. It is delicious now, but with that toast still showing strongly, it should age over 2–3 years to be at its best.",89.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"You can feel the wood, rather than tasting it, such is the delicious fruit character: layers of ripe white fruits, shot through with citrus, white figs and crisp nectarine. The wine is edging towards youthful austerity but the fruit gives it great life and freshness. Imported by Robert Kacher Imports.",178.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Intensely fruity initially, with red cherry and raspberry fruit flavors, this wine then opens into more secondary flavors. There is a definite barnyard, smoky edge, followed by dark, dry tannins and a mineral edge. It is worth aging for 3–4 years.",75.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A rich wine, with delicious juicy white fruit flavors that roll around the mouth. The fruits are right up front initially, but then the structure of toast, apple skin tannins and some spice come in, giving fine complexity, promising good aging. Keep for 4–5 years, probably more. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd. Cellar Selection.",108.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A finely made ripe wine benefiting from low yields. The fruit is sweet raspberry juice, with a wonderful burst of fresh acidity. While there are tannins to show restraint, they are way behind the precise, delicious mouthfilling fruit. Worth aging for 3–4 years.",64.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Jessiaume also runs a negociant business, and this Meursault is a good example. With a ripe, full white-fruit flavor, a note of smoky wood and a rounded texture, it is developing well, if fast. Drink over the next 4–5 years.",115.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A rich wine that's full of ripe creamed-pear and apricot flavors, this has an open feel that contrasts with tangy, mineral acidity.",30.00,Alsace,Riesling
"While the texture is rich and full-bodied, there is an edge of sharp acidity that takes away from the generous ripeness. Tannins and juicy red fruits are present, but the acidity is a little jarring.",68.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This is light and fruity, with its red fruit upfront. The tannins are balanced, in keeping with the wine's perfumed nature. The youthful acidity on the finish is likely to soften out in a year.",16.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Boasts notes typical of the dark side of Syrah--black olive and espresso--yet never really takes charge. Instead, it's a plump, lightly textured wine that would be easy enough to drink if not particularly memorable.",32.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"The second wine of Médoc Château La Cardonne is a light, fruity wine with red berry fruits, acidity and a fresh tannin character. It is pleasingly ready to drink now.",17.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A wine that is perfumed with new wood. The fruit has the freshness of 2007, high acids, cranberry juice, not weighty. Needs to age for another year.",19.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend

"This is an ambitious effort, with prominent sawdust and campfire notes from toasty new oak that lead to a dense palate with muscular tannins and strawberry fruit that carries over to the medium finish. Give this one a few years in the cellar to come together.",37.00,Provence,Red_Blend
"A quirky wine, but largely successful, with upfront tones of clove-spiced orange peel and baking bread followed by dried fruit notes in the mouth. The long finish is on the sweet side and winds down to a note of Asian candy.",55.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"With no indication on the label, it would be hard to know that this is a sweet wine. That is a shame, because the wine itself is ripe and opulent, layering honey and sweet lychee flavors. There's even room for an attractive edge of acidity.",33.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"This wine is made using both white and red versions of Muscat, which accounts for its pale copper color. The bouquet is floral and rose-like, with a bit of nasturtium-like pepperiness as well. It's weighty and slightly warm, decadently rich in peach, white chocolate and honey flavors that linger on the persistent finish.",31.00,Rhône_Valley,Muscat_Blanc_à_Petit_Grain

"The 2009 vintage was a warm, dry one in the southern Rhône, lending itself to the production of rich dessert wines like this one.

It's full bodied and softly tannic, with lingering notes of cocoa powder and dried spice on the finish.",28.00,Rhône_Valley,Grenache
"Chapuy is a négociant based in Mesnil-sur-Oger in the Chardonnay vineyards of the Côte des Blancs.

"Light and fragrant, this emphasizes crisp apple and grapefruit flavors. It has a light, breezy character. Very ready to drink.",20.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay

"This 75% Roussanne/25% Bourboulenc blend beautifully expresses its terroir by way of a nose full of garrigue herbs—predominantly fresh thyme and bay leaves—against a backdrop of red apple aromas. The palate is rich and full, with flavors of wood-grilled stone fruit, toasted walnuts and orange essence.",38.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_White_Blend

"Here's a wine that is fine and fresh as well as structured. Apple skin and citrus juice flavors are cut through with mature toast flavors. The result is rich, its mouthfeel full and its aftertaste tight and tangy.",89.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"For a wine without a reputation for aging, this is surprisingly good. It's very lush and honeyed, with a viscous texture and a long, sweet finish. Try it with desserts rather than as an apéritif.",19.00,Rhône_Valley,Muscat

"Notes of burnt caramel, dried date, mocha and fresh savory herb like thyme and bay leaf complement the umami and rancio accents of mushroom and nut, creating a fantastic complexity to the nose and mouth of this aged Rivesaltes. Thick and viscous, it has a heavy character that's marked by prune, caramel sauce and roasted spice on the close.",35.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,White_Blend

With its weight and density, try with cream-based seafood entrées like lobster newburg.",40.00,France_Other,Viognier

"A rounded wine that exudes a flavor of warm yellow fruit. With its weight, the fruitiness comes through strongly, leaving an attractive tang of acidity on the finish.",20.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A dirty nose spoils this otherwise attractive, easy, crisp Chablis. The palate has some notes of yeast and bright white fruit, with a citrusy finish.",21.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay

"Almost black in color, this is a wonderful wine with a long development ahead. At the moment, wood is still too dominant, but just taste the weight of the darkest plum and sweet fig fruit flavors, a line of licorice and bitter coffee and huge, dry tannins.",60.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"Despite the 100% new wood, this wine (GC stands for Grand Cru) is beautifully restrained. It has such delicious fruit and the ripest of tannins, pierced with the wood flavors, but never dominated by them. It is obviously a wine for aging, still bursting with fresh fruit and acidity.",135.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"This Blanquette (made with 90% Mauzac) offers a bouquet full of bright crisp red apple and melon core. The texture is creamy with fine bubbles and medium acidity, and the palate is loaded with satisfying sweet citrus rind and toasty brioche flavors.

"Fruity, ripe and round, this is simple Chardonnay that gives pleasure from its warm texture and softness. The apple flavor leads to a gentle finish.",15.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is a combination of tropical fruits and tight acidity, making for an unbalanced wine that seems not to know its way.",23.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"An atypical offering, this full-bodied Riesling possessing a slightly oily texture is saturated with a creamy butteryness and earthy essences such as mushroom and truffle. While hints of white peach might surface in the mouth, it is surprisingly easy to take pleasure in its other slightly odd and unexpected characteristics.",24.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Soft, medium sweet wine with hints of honey, light apricot and acidity. This is a wine for chicken dishes or as an apéritif.",14.00,Loire_Valley,Malvoisie

"This vintage rosé, made with 57% Chardonnay, 28% Chenin Blanc, 10% Mauzac and 5% Pinot Noir, is a perfect match for tomato-cream sauce dishes or insalata Caprese.

"Tannat at its most expressive, this wine boasts dense tannins that roll deeply around the wine. But the fruit is of such an intensity that it keeps up a fine equilibrium. It is a seamless, impressive wine, projecting its power easily.",25.00,Southwest_France,Tannat
"Harvested in November 2007, this is sweet wine from the Madiran region of Gascony. In fact, it has dryness as much as sweetness, with perfumed flavors of white figs, nutmeg and touches of wood. The acidity goes right through to keep it all beautifully fresh.",25.00,Southwest_France,Petit_Manseng
This is a yeasty wine that shows a bitter almond character. It has an unattractive hard edge.,28.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Modest notes of lanolin and nuts up front are followed by a rather thin, off-dry palate. Appealing toasty notes on the finish fade away rather quickly. Drink now.",25.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"Attractive aromas of mineral and slate are hampered by some musty notes. Nonetheless, the palate is well-structured, with refreshing acidity reinforcing mineral notes. This is an austere, dry style perfect for those who shy away from the fruitier examples.",20.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Straightforward but good, here's an easy-drinking everyday wine with light tannins, a satisfyingly round mouthfeel and assertive dark fruit flavors. A touch of milk chocolate appears on the close.",11.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot
"Caramel aromas along with ripe strawberry flavors give an underlying softness. It has some acidity, certainly, giving a lift to this attractive wine that comes from vines in the hills above Nuits Saint-Georges.",12.00,Burgundy,Rosé

"This organic Chardonnay offers notes of soft pear, grass and citrus on the nose, while sweet citrus oil dominates the medium- weight mouth. A touch of melon rind unfolds on the short finish. Easy to drink, and drink now.",18.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay

"This is a gorgeous wine, the ripe fruit of the year giving weight, the dry botrytis giving intensity. Ginger, sweet orange and a big burst of citrus all balance so well.",57.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"This is the show stopper of the range from Alain Dominique Perrin's Lagrezette. It expresses the most powerful Malbec tannins and superripe fruit, without losing sight of the mineral edge. The fruit of this beautiful wine, while opulent, is poised with fine acidity.",110.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"Flavors of ripest apricots with orange zest, mango juice and a powerful core of botrytis. This is a beautiful wine, with an exotic character that continually fascinates. Ready to drink.",25.00,Southwest_France,Petit_Manseng
"This is bitter, with hints of sulfur, yeast and almond. It's soft in texture and lacking fruit.",20.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Those who seek out Gewürztraminer for its intense, exotic nose will want to look elsewhere. Despite the subtle aromatic profile, the rich palate is bursting with flavors of rose water, spice and cloves. It finishes fairly dry, with just a hint of residual sugar.",17.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"There is a depth of flavor and concentration from low-yield old vines. The style gives raspberry flavors and acidity, with a light tannic character.",19.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir

"This straightforward wine is tasty and approachable, with flavors of red apple, hard peach and orange acidity. Round and satisfying in the mouth; drink up.",12.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Viognier
"A very subdued expression of the normally flamboyant Gewürztraminer grape, the opening notes are of wool and mineral. The full-bodied palate has accents of candied orange rind and toast. Good for those who can't deny Gewürz's ability to flatter Asian food, but who prefer a more subtle wine.",22.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"The B&G; line doesn't disappoint in value, and here you get a delicious Chard for under $10. Vibrant tropical fruit, melon, and peach fill the round mouth, and though the finish is short it is also clean. Drink now.",8.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay

"Perfumed with white flowers, this wine is crisp, bright and light in character. Lovely, pure acidity is highlighted in an attractive combination.",14.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc

"Open and primal on nose, this has notes of game, roasted meat, lead pencil, green bell pepper and blackberry. It offers succulent fruit on the midpalate, accompanied by generous viscosity and oak. The wine sits broadly across the palate with significant heft, chewy tannins and moderate acidity. The harmony of flavors and structure lingers onto the lengthy finish.",45.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"With its massively concentrated blackberry fruit framed in ample new oak, this bears a bit of resemblance to some Australian Shirazes. It's mouthfilling but supple, with nuances of Christmas spices like cinnamon, clove and anise that linger on the long finish. Drink 2014–2023.",90.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"From a new winery that's bottle-aging its wines prior to release, this is a blend of 80% Grenache and 20% Syrah. Because the vineyards straddle multiple appellations, it carries a modest Vin de Pays de Vaucluse label, but this is serious stuff. It's dense and creamy in texture, with a long, velvety finish and flavors of chocolate, black olive and dark plum. Drink now–2020.",100.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Made from grape must that is heated before fermentation, this is powerful and concentrated, with a rich and very dense character. Prune, dried fruit and fresh plum notes combine with an intense background of acidity. Age for at least five years.",50.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"The subdued nose on this example will appeal to drinkers who avoid fruity, highly aromatic wines. The fairly concentrated palate, which shows some pleasant nutty notes, is slightly off-dry but the finish is crisp due to a good level of supporting acidity. Serve with baked or pan-seared fish.",20.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"The gold color and developed, bready aromas attest to the fact that this wine has a few years of age. On the palate, more youthful flavors of honey, nuts and roses are evident. The finish is surprisingly crisp, making it a good partner for drier Asian-fusion dishes.",29.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"What would convince a producer to call a wine Jovly seems to be a mystery. That said, the wine is fresh, rounded with plenty of orange juice acidity, honey and a soft finish. Screwcap.",12.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Lightweight but round, this Merlot is missing a bit of lushness to its dark fruit core, with more skin-driven flavors of cherry and plum.",12.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot
"This wine is quite the bargain, offering nice fruit and spice for under $10. Simply structured with soft tannins, juicy black currant and plum flavors all accented by a hint of pepper. Drink now.",8.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Cabernet_Sauvignon
"Here's a simple but enjoyable Cab with notes of black plum, violet and cassis. Medium weight with soft tannins and a solid finish.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Cabernet_Sauvignon
"Light Pinot Noir, with crisp raspberry flavors. The very fruity wine has an edge of bitterness to go with the acidity.",14.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Lemony, fruit-driven wine, very crisp in character, with lightness and delicacy. Acidity and a touch of pear flavor offer balance.",15.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"The aromas and flavors of this wine are not too intense, with soft suggestions of strawberry hull and ripe banana. Surprisingly weighty and round in the mouth.",11.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé
"With some weight, this has raspberry flavor to go with its sweetness. Berry fruits dominate in a wine that is full in the mouth.",16.00,Loire_Valley,Rosé
"Ame means the spirit, the soul, and Alain Rotier believes this wine expresses the true nature of his Gaillac estate. On that basis, it's a place of great perfumes, coming through in the wine from wood as well as chunky black fruits. It is a relatively soft wine, the concentration in the dense fruit rather than the tannins.",40.00,Southwest_France,Duras
"The aromas of wood and orange marmalade hint at the richness of this wine. To taste, it is certainly powered by wood, but also has vivid freshness from crisp white peaches, spice and toast.",33.00,Southwest_France,Petit_Manseng
"When some of the greatest Cahors weigh in at 13.5% alcohol, there is no need for this 15.5% monster. It's a shame, because there is much to admire here, with the powerful bitter chocolate and the sweetest berry fruits, a wall of polished concentration. It needs aging for four years at least.",60.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"The neglected third grape of white Bergerac (as also in Bordeaux), after Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon, is Muscadelle. It forms the impressive base for this wine. It has a rich character, heavily spiced with wood, nutmeg, perfumed with violets and lemon verbena. This serious, impressive wine is for aging, the toast character still dominant.",33.00,Southwest_France,Muscadel
"Blending Duras, Braucol and Syrah, this is a powerful wine, perfumed and dominated by tannins from fruit and wood. There is a great juiciness as well, with the black cherry and black currant fruits bursting around the mouth. For aging—allow at least 5–6 years.",23.00,Southwest_France,Red_Blend
"Loaded with black cherry and plum fruit, this is an amply endowed Châteauneuf-du-Pape that avoids excess. The fruit flavors remain fresh and vibrant, the oaking is understated and the wine's size is ably supported by soft tannins and just-sufficient acidity. Drink now–2020.",70.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A full-bodied, rich wine, with tannins either supremely smoooth or just concealed under masses of plummy fruit. Yet despite the enormous ripeness, it's not lacking nuance, boasting savory notes of espresso and leather. Drinkable now, but should age through 2023, at least.",84.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"This seems awfully civilized for Cornas, with bold, clean blueberry fruit front and center, anchored by a framework of cedar and vanilla. This full-bodied, lush, creamy expression of Northern Rhône Syrah should drink well through 2025. Imported by DHI Selections, T. Edward Wines Ltd",50.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"In this difficult vintage, Guigal's Château Ampuis bottling shines. The kinky nose features exotic notes of celery seed, cracked pepper, hickory smoke and mixed berries, while in the mouth the wine shows ample fullness and intensity without losing any of the silky character that makes Côte Rôtie special. Drink now–2020.",160.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"The top cuvée from Mas del Périé, this is a concentrated wine, with new wood and black fruit notes. It's packed with intense tannins, spice from the wood aging and a great depth of flavor. This is an impressive wine that will need to age for at least 5–6 years.",85.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"This full-bodied, creamy Crozes-Hermitage far outpaces expectations for the appellation, combining cherry-berry fruit with cracked pepper, mocha and licorice. Then it finishes long, anchored by a marriage of fruit and spice. It's ready to drink now, but should evolve positively through at least 2017.",36.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"A highlight of The Furst range, this Pinot Blanc offers up a flowery bouquet redolent of white lilies. It is lush in the mouth and more concentrated and full-bodied than most of its brethren, with pretty orange and honey notes. Drink up.",14.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"This wine presents an unusual aroma profile with notes of dough and cheese overlaying a base of mineral and lime. The palate is simple and austere with a short finish redolent of peaches. Overall, a bit disappointing for a Grand Cru.",25.00,Alsace,Riesling
"This is a classic, entry-level Alsace Pinot Gris, with an uncomplicated mineral-driven nose. The slightly watery palate displays some nice Asian spice flavors and slight residual sugar. A decent choice though there are better values to be had at this price.",18.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"Fresh, bright wine that feels light in texture and weight. That makes it suited for shellfish rather than more intense dishes. Attractive, ready to drink.",18.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"An attractively simple, fruity Pinot Noir. It has ripe wild strawberry and red plum flavors, spiced with a gamy edge. The wine has a light structure, and is not for aging.",12.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
This medium- weight Chard shows some grass and green plum notes alongside riper accents of apple and honeysuckle. Might be past its prime; try the 2010.,12.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
A light but easy-drinking white with flavors of fresh gooseberry and grapefruit pith. Light -weight with a short but clean finish; pair with summer salads.,11.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Lightweight fresh fruit flavors, mostly grapefruit and clean freshness. The wine is attractively fruity in style.",13.00,Loire_Valley,Melon
This is a full-bodied rosé with soft red berry and tart cherry flavors intertwined with notes of white chocolate. The finish could last a bit longer. Drink up.,16.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé
"An easy, fruity wine, its attractive red cherry flavors bubbling away in soft tannins and light acidity. Very drinkable, and not for aging.",20.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Here's a delicate white that's a nice poolside sipper, with soft suggestions of white florals, tropical fruit and sweet citrus. The palate is clean and balanced with pineapple-flavored acidity keeping things vibrant in the mouth.",11.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Viognier
"This is the lighter of two sweet wines from Ancienne Cure, but this is still pretty intense. It has great sweet marmalade and orange zest flavors, as much sweet as botrytized. Soft, round and opulent.",30.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Classic botrytis sweet and dry flavors bring out the rich honey and lemon juice. The wine also has freshness, a tight edge of orange and sweet chutney spice. A great example of sweet Gaillac.",30.00,Southwest_France,Loin_de_l'Oeil
"The perfumes of wood mingle with sweet Malbec berry fruit aromas. The wine is in a style that initially emphasizes the fresh, juicy fruit. Then it moves in on the tannins to give a densely dry wine, finishing with a tight, mineral edge.",21.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"Even Grand Veneur's traditional cuvée shines in 2009, offering up notions of black cherries and chocolate liqueur. It's full bodied and richly textured, with a long, velvety finish. Simply put, it's plush and delicious, with no need to age it any further. Drink now–2020.",53.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Despite this wine's thick veneer of toasty, vanilla-scented oak, it has plenty of underlying fruit, powerful enough to handle the wood. It's full bodied, dense and richly textured, with a long, velvety finish redolent of blackberries and cedar. Approachable now, but should easily age through 2025.",60.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
The disappointingly quiet nose gives way to a palate laced with bready notes. Citrus peel adds interest to the palate while crisp acidity gives the one-dimensional finish a lift. A bit of a letdown for the great Schlossberg vineyard.,23.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Notes of botrytis add interest to an otherwise rather straightforward nose. The palate is likewise one-dimensional, but gets a charge from appealing notes of lemon rind. The wine is nicely balanced, with fresh acidity lifting the moderately concentrated palate.",27.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Dry, yes, but this wine is also soft and ripe. It has an attractive toasty character giving power to the midpalate. It's in the finish that the real acidity and dryness show most.",52.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Based on Pinot Noir, this attractive rosé is packed with wild strawberry and fresh orange zest flavors. It's  beautifully clean, crisp, with just a warmer touch in the aftertaste.",25.00,Alsace,Sparkling_Blend
"Soft, sweet wine with crushed strawberry flavors that show a high dosage and sweet acidity. It is full-bodied, rich, but not well balanced.",50.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"An intriguing blend of Négrette, Syrah and Malbec, this wine is a selection of the best lots of the vintage. It has purity of blackberry fruit, edged with an earthy, barnyard character. It is ripe, generous, but not overweight.",26.00,Southwest_France,Red_Blend
"Powerfully rich, with plenty of the dry tannins of Tannat, but also rich sweet plum fruits and concentrated wood to soften and round. There is acidity, but it fits comfortably into the firm fruits and solid final chunkiness.",20.00,Southwest_France,Tannat
"With a little extra bottle age, this wine shows great charm and style. The dense fruits are finely restrained, but have all the solidity of a juicy Malbec, spiced with the driest tannin and a core of powerful minerality. For further aging, 3–4 years.",30.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"A beautifully balanced Monbazillac, giving attention to orange marmalade flavors, while resting securely on botrytis. The wine is generous but firm, with final acidity. A wine for aging.",13.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"With its high wood aromas and high toast on the palate, this is a wine that has leached out the fruit for the moment. It is austere, mineral, leaving the black fruits very secondary for the next three years. The finish, though, has promising juiciness.",20.00,Southwest_France,Tannat
"With flavors of the freshest pears, green herbs and perfumed white currants, this is a deliciously enticing wine. The acidity is bright, crisp, but it is attractively filled out with ripe fruits and a wonderful herbal character.",19.00,Southwest_France,White_Blend
"Hugely concentrated, powerful and ageworthy, this has mint and new wood aromas. It has rich damson and blackberry fruits that push through the mineral texture and dark tannins, filling the mouth with its exuberant ripeness. Age for four years.",40.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"This is the current release from Guigal, which makes it one of the few Hermitages on store shelves that's ready to drink. It's medium to full in weight, chunky and assertive, but not overly concentrated or tannic. Instead, it delivers beefy notes of coffee, black olive and spice, backed by hints of raspberries and cedar.",90.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Very soft, ripe, this is a gentle sparkler. White fruits dominate along with crushed almond, layered acidity and a bone-dry perfumed aftertaste.",19.00,Alsace,Sparkling_Blend
"A creamed pear wine, with an attractive tang of orange zest. It is light, bright, vibrant, very fruity. The acidity does seem to be excessive, so give this wine a few months in bottle.",23.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"The concentration that Christian Roche produces here is immense, a wine that has dark tannins, the most bitter of chocolate flavors and peppered cherry fruits. Even after four years, this is nowhere open yet, the tannins and the heavy toast wood still dark and dry. Age for 3–4 years more.",30.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The home vineyard of the Vigouroux family has produced an elegant wine, its fruit finely in keeping with freshness as well as solid, dry classic Malbec tannins. The wine's fruit is just an element in this well-balanced wine.",20.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"An intensely concentrated wine, with tannins that float in an inky sea of dense berry fruits. The wine is smooth, the edges softened by wood, but the fruit tannins pour out of the glass.",45.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"Wood and spice layer over fruit that has a creamy, Chardonnay-like character. There is herbaceousness, but the rich yellow fruits and exuberant nutmeg and pepper from the alcohol are dominant here. At this young stage, it needs to calm down.",45.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"A big, burly, rich wine, with the Tannat tannins only just tamed by the ripe black spicy fruit. It has a real weight to it, packed with solid, structured and aromatic fruits, a great powerhouse. It is worth aging for 2–3 years.",15.00,Southwest_France,Tannat-Cabernet
"The wine is textured, layered with minerality, green apple skins, peppered pears and acidity. It is very young, a work in progress as the wood integrates with the fruit. But, over 2–3 years, it will develop into a ripe, full-bodied wine.",28.00,Southwest_France,Petit_Manseng
"A terrific value, Magni's Côtes du Rhône comes from an area just outside Châteauneuf-du-Pape's Coudoulet lieu dit. The blend of 75% Grenache and 25% Syrah is full bodied and richly textured, with vibrant fruit flavors of dark berries and savory overtones. Its long, velvety finish suggests drinking now and over the next 5–8 years.",20.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This blend of 60% Grenache, 20% Syrah and 20% Mourvèdre delivers juicy, almost gulpable fruit, supported by a loose spine of soft tannins. Purple raspberry and black cherry flavors linger on the supple finish. Drink now–2018.",35.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This is Les Vins de Vienne's upscale Crozes, and it's very successful in 2009, featuring bold, concentrated blackberry fruit supported by hints of vanilla and toast. It's full bodied and richly textured, with a long, layered finish. Drink now–2020.",40.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Chapoutier has fashioned a full-bodied, creamy-textured 2009 Le Bernardine, with dark, plummy fruit and a hint of chocolate liqueur that ably reflect the warm vintage. Yet despite all of the lushness, the wine doesn't come across as heavy or overdone, making it attractive for early drinking. Try now–2018.",56.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"If the oak integrates better and recedes more into the fruit than I suspect, this rating will look conservative. Right now, oak is front and center, arrayed in ranks of toasted cedar and vanilla. It's full bodied and chewy in texture, with a long, plushly oaky finish. Try after 2015.",80.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"The blend is 70% Syrah, 20% Grenache and 10% Carignan, and in 2009 the grapes were as ripe as they could be. Mocha and chocolate notes pick up a touch of prune. With its superripe fruit, ample weight, lush texture and warm finish, there are valid concerns about its ageability, but this offers hedonistic drinking for an affordable price.",17.00,France_Other,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Crisp, dry and easy-to-drink, this mineral-driven selection will please fans of Pinot Grigio. With light flavors of mixed nuts, the palate does not make a memorable impression. Drink now.",12.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"From a vineyard managed by the Vigouroux family, Leret Monpezat's wine is big, dry, its massive dark fruit a powerful underlay for a series of tannins. The wine's depth is immense, powerful, a great concentration of licorice and blackberry flavors. Age for 3–4 years.",12.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"A beautifully perfumed wine, not as powerful as some wines from Le Cèdre but with style and elegance from the balanced sweet fruits and juicy acidity. There is wood here, but it is subtle, allowing the fruit to sing.",30.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"Almond paste aromas and an attractive entry for a full-bodied wine that keeps freshness through bright pear and apricot juice flavors and a touch of spicy wood. The acidity shows slowly, but then brings in a wonderful series of citrus flavors.",23.00,Southwest_France,White_Blend
"The wine's name comes from the Adour River that flows through the Madiran region. This is dark colored, powerful and spicy, with weight and richness that should allow this to age for at least four years.",17.00,Southwest_France,Tannat
"Dense and almost black in color, this is concentrated, with intense tannins and black plum fruit. It bursts with the rich fruit and acidity, finishing on a smoky, juicy note.",25.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"As in many 2009s from the Northern Rhône, the Syrah fruit is superripe. Add in aging in 100% new oak barrels and the result is a big, richly tannic wine redolent of vanilla, cedar and blackberries. Drink now–2025.",50.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"This super bargain reflects the charm of the 2011 vintage in its supple tannins and forward fruit. It's lush and creamy textured, with expressive notes of kirsch, spice and cocoa. Drink now–2017.",16.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"The normally flamboyant Gewürztraminer grape makes an understated appearance in this wine. The subdued nose is reminiscent of beer nuts while lychee and rose flavors dominate the slightly watery palate. It finishes dry, with an acidic lift. Try with Vietnamese takeout.",18.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"Youthful apple and pear notes introduce a simple, slightly dilute palate. Tart finish.",14.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Fresh raspberry-flavored sparkling wine, with vivid acidity but also some softness. It has a bright, crisp texture, lively and refreshing. The wine comes from a small parcel next to the Hospices de Saumur.",22.00,France_Other,White_Blend
"From selected parcels of the Bélingard vineyard, this is a firm and rich wine, with excellent concentration. The tannins are firm, dusty, broken by ripe plums and sweet acidity. The 18 months of wood aging shows in the polish of the wine. Age for another year.",30.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A wine that is in an in-between stage from youthful freshness to maturity. There is sweetness, a layer of botrytis, crisp sweet apple character, fading and becoming more toffee-like. The acidity, though, remains. Wait another year.",30.00,Southwest_France,Petit_Manseng
"There's pure lychee fragrance on this rich, smooth and oily-textured wine. It is ripe and off-dry, with honey and white fruit flavors that are offset by spice. Screwcap.",17.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"Textbook floral aromas take on both ripe tropical notes and a sharp citrusy-herbal character. This moderately sweet Muscat displays a supple, round feel in the mouth, with melon and orange-lime flavors and a slightly bitter finish.",28.00,Rhône_Valley,Muscat
"This wine starts off with vanilla, cinnamon and dark cherry notes on the nose, with the oak-derived elements marrying nicely with the Grenache fruit. It's full bodied, liquorous and lush, with a long, velvety finish. Probably best over the next 4–5 years.",37.00,Rhône_Valley,Grenache
"Morel, the general manager at M. Chapoutier, also has his own label, which includes this very attractive wine from Sign­argues, the southernmost villages appellation of the Côte du Rhône. It's full bodied and ripe without being flabby or unstructured, delivering blueberry and blackberry fruit, peppery spice and a long finish that reverberates with fruit and an espresso note.",20.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"The blend of this Chêne Bleu wine is 65% Syrah, 30% Grenache and 5% Viognier, and with its elevated proportion of Syrah come bacony, mocha and olivaceous components reminiscent of the Northern Rhône. It's full bodied, warm and velvety, with a long finish filled with chocolaty richness. Ready to drink.",100.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This is beautifully structured, packed with black fruits, ripe tannins and balanced acidity. It's still young, showing the black fruit side of Malbec, but the tannins are already integrating well into the structure. Age for 4–5 years.",23.00,Southwest_France,Malbec-Merlot
"More than half of the blend is Viognier, which no doubt accounts for its dramatic aromas and flavors of exotic tropical fruit, only just reined in by more citrusy notes. It's full bodied and round in the mouth without being at all flabby, with a crisp, clean, lingering finish. Drink it over the next year.",19.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"A round wine, the flavors initially created by soft textures. Then the wine shows as more concentrated, the acidity bursting out of white fruits, an intense citrus character and an herbaceous texture. The final taste is perfumed and ripe.",20.00,Southwest_France,White_Blend
"Biodynamically run, Château Tour des Gendres is at the top of the tree in Bergerac. This beautifully fruity wine shows freshness as well as depth of tannins, complex berry and bitter chocolate flavors. It is firm, but as a sign of the vintage, has a light character with final freshness.",26.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The beautifully perfumed Gros Manseng should, by rights, be as popular as Chardonnay. This medium-sweet wine is all apricots, pears and honey, with a delicious fresh waft of acidity. Screwcap.",14.00,Southwest_France,Gros_Manseng
"Lush, ripe and a touch heady, this is a rich selection that's brimming with notes of white peach, quince, melon and red apple. Thankfully, hints of ginger, nectarine pit and citrus rind add lift to the palate and remain through the medium-length finish.",12.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Muscat_Blanc_à_Petit_Grain
"This is a softly floral wine, with citrus and fresh pear notes that accompany green apple. It is ripe and fruity, with a light tang of orange on the finish. Screwcap.",15.00,Alsace,Riesling
"There's classic lychee fruit on this rich, full-in-the-mouth Gewürztraminer. It's ripe, opulent and generous, offering a great burst of spicy flavors that have just a touch of sweetness to them. Screwcap.",19.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"Officially launched in 2011, this is a fresh and fruity style of the classic fortified wine. Lively notes of strawberry and cream, white cherry and fresh bay leaf dance on the nose, while the palate boasts flavors of small red berry and vanilla spice.",20.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Grenache
"This selection shows pure black-cherry fruit on the nose, then it folds in hints of flowers, spices, chocolate and coffee on the palate. It's full bodied and creamy in texture without being heavy, then finishes long. Ready to drink, but should easily hold another 5–6 years.",30.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"This is a wine that teeters on the edge between superripeness and overripeness. At one moment its fruit comes across as slightly herbal and raspberry-like, while the next it can seem slightly raisined, with a hint of nail polish. It's round and creamy in texture, with a long finish framed in elegant, soft tannins. Drink now–2018.",74.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Made using selections of the best parcels from Jaubertie, this is a complex and structured wine. Mint and new wood flavors are still dominant, although the fruit shows its black fruit richness. Age for over four years.",20.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The nose is loaded with mineral, pencil lead and blackberry notes. Generously juicy on the palate, this exudes youthful fruit backed by terroir-influenced notes. The tannins are structured and lightly sinewy yet soft all at once. The acidity is fresh, carrying the well-concentrated flavors of this chunky wine into a medium finish. This is a decidedly Old World in style, with evident fruit purity and provenance of place. Drink now and for three more years.",14.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Atypical for the appellation in that it's 80% Syrah, this is a dark-fruited, slightly pruny Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Chocolate and licorice notes add complexity to this full-bodied, firmly structured wine. With its long, chewy finish, consider deferring consumption until at least 2014.",68.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This négociant's top cuvée of Saint-Joseph has vibrant mixed berry notes that pick up lovely hints of licorice and garrigue, then turn chocolaty and velvety on the finish. Nicely done all the way around, with a drinking window extending from now through 2017.",42.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"The two great white grapes of southwest France, Gros Manseg and Petit Manseng, are blended together to create this crisp, peach- and citrus-flavored wine. A spice note adds a more exotic edge, while the wine finishes with tight, tangy acidity.",17.00,Southwest_France,Gros_and_Petit_Manseng
"More Tardieu-Laurent than Côtes du Rhône, with hallmark exotic, nearly tropical notes suggestive of toasted coconut, vanilla and apricot. It's full bodied and plush in texture, with a long, cedary and velvety finish. Drink it over the next few years.",28.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Cos d'Estournel has softened those austere Saint-Estèphe tannins and produced a wine that is all opulence and roundness. The tannins are certainly there, but they come through as big, bold richness. The power suggests it will age well, but for drinking earlier, the freshness of the sweet homemade plum jam promises well.",200.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"It is the poise, the elegance of Coutet that shows so well in this delicious wine. It is ripe, with layers of apricot and peach, lifted with spice and an over-arching sweet acidity that gives the wine a wonderful, heart-stopping lift.",50.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Although it begins with austerity, its acidity and tannins dominant,  the palate opens beyond its youthfulness after a few moments. It becomes dark and powerful, certainly still dryly tannic, but the fruit is generous, and the final taste is of beautiful, ripe fruits.",56.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The success of this wine owes as much to Merlot as to Cabernet. The Merlot has created the ripeness and smoothness of the wine. While the Cabernet keeps it firm and closed up, there is a base of rich, sweet fruit here that will show over the next two years. The style of the wine is moving away from elegance to power under the new regime of owners, Champagne Roederer.",210.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Year after year, Lynch-Bages is able to produce sumptuous wines, typically rich, powerful and structured. This is solid, the blackberry ripe fruit enveloping this structure with a velvet sheen. This is developing into one of the successes of the vintage.",85.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Soft, tangy and fruity, this is a ripe wine that shows both freshness and richness. It's approachable now, and full of creamed apple flavor. Delicious to drink as an apéritif. Screwcap.",15.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"This is a finely structured, tarry-flavored wine, with notes of herbs and sweet spices along with mature fruits. It's rich and full bodied, with just a touch of pepper. Drink now or age for another year.",25.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This is a firm, chunky wine that shows ripe plum fruit and dark tannins. It has weight and richness that are balanced by the dense structure. It needs to age for at least four years.",20.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This full-bodied blend of 60% Clairette and 40% Roussanne is probably best consumed over the next several months. The apple and tangerine aromas and flavors are inviting, and there's a minerally sensation of wet stones underneath.",47.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"This full-bodied, lushly textured wine is 100% Viognier. Despite being aged nearly a year and a half in French oak, it retains a peppery aroma of nasturtium blossom along with toast and honey notes. Toasted nuts figure prominently on the palate, with just enough fruit weight to support the oak, while a touch of honey lingers on the finish. Drink now.",65.00,France_Other,Viognier
"A terrific value in French Viognier, this “simple” Vin de Pays displays full-on floral aromas of honeysuckle and rose pollen, fleshed out on the palate by hints of apricot and pineapple. It's medium to full in body, with a slightly creamy texture and a dusting of tannin and white pepper on the finish. Drink it over the next year or so.",20.00,Rhône_Valley,Viognier
"This is nicely floral on the nose, with black cherry fruit accented by hints of thyme and bay leaf, while the flavors are a harmonious mélange of herb, spice and ripe fruit. It's full bodied and slightly chewy at first, turning more velvety on the finish. Drink now–2017.",23.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"A medium-bodied blend of Syrah, Grenache and Carignan, this wine offers a supple feel and plenty of red berry and cherry fruit, with just enough spice to give it additional interest. Drink it over the next year or two.",15.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This wine has plenty to offer, from brightly fruity and peppery aromas to flavors of cherry, leather amd spice. The tannins are silky in texture, and the lengthy finish develops hints of cocoa and clove.",40.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Benefiting from the great quality of Cabernet Franc in 2006, this is a beautiful wine, perfumed and seductive. The fruit tannins are so well integrated with wood that they are only just dominant. Ripe, opulent but also firmly structured, this will age magnificently over five years or more.",260.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"While there is some botrytis here, this wine is not heavily into that style. Rather it shows freshness, with its white currant and grapefruit acidity and delicate perfume. There is a fine core of sweet apple skin tannins to finish.",23.00,Southwest_France,White_Blend
"A bright, breezy, fruity wine, wearing its fresh fruit and acidity easily. Grapefruit and other citrus fruits burst out of the glass, finishing with an apple skin structure.",18.00,Southwest_France,White_Blend
"The Négrette grape is unique to Fronton, the vineyard just outside Toulouse in south-west France. This pure Négrette shows the juicy side of the grape, high in acidity, with piercing black currants and spice.",18.00,Southwest_France,Negrette
"A rare rosé style of VDN Rasteau, this nonvintage cuvée is pale copper in color, with aromas and flavors of peach and toasted almond. It's nicely silky in texture, with a mouthwatering finish.",20.00,Rhône_Valley,Grenache
"This lively, raspberry- and red-currant-flavored wine has just the right tang of acidity to create its crisp feel. Fruity and fragrant, it features a touch of minerality to add further texture.",20.00,Alsace,Sparkling_Blend
"Full bodied and plush in texture, with extremely supple tannins alongside flavors of raspberry, plum and clove. The juicy beam of fresh fruit lingers nicely on the finish. Drink now–2018.",20.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Shows some oak aging in its aromas of cedar, caramel and baking spices, but also in the velvety mouthfeel and slightly drying finish. Thankfully, there are just enough ripe cherries to carry the freight, so while purists may be dismayed, plenty more will enjoy the wine's mix of fruit and oak. Drink now–2018.",40.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This is a silky-textured, medium-bodied Châteauneuf-du-Pape, with lifted red-berry fruit and grace notes of thyme blossom and bay leaf. It's a truly elegant style, with a supple, mouth-watering finish. Drink now–2018.",51.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This wood-aged cuvée from Château Belingard has great weight and concentration while also showing dense spice and blackberry flavors. At this stage, it is showing the wood; but in another year, it will round out and its dark juicy fruit will come forward.",25.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This wood-aged wine shows equal notes of toasty spice and ripe fruit. On the palate, it's full and round, with pear and apricot flavors giving it richness. This is concentrated and worth aging for another 2–3 years.",19.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Biting acidity, tight with a tart edge, give this wine a seriously crisp character. It is all sharp edges, with grapefruit intensity and a final almond character.",15.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"From a small, single-vineyard plot of 3.5 acres, this shows intense fruit, very aromatic in character. Its concentration is immense, dark black fruits vying with spice, tar and sweet plum pudding flavors. The Cabernet Franc shows through well here, giving a perfumed finish.",100.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"In a modern, smooth style, with plush fruit and dusty tannins, this is a ripe, open wine, an easy expression of Malbec, New World in its fruitiness.",9.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"Light tannins hide the fact that this is a dense wine, its stalky fruit going deep into tannins and acidity. Flavors of bitter chocolate go with spice and red berries. To drink within the year.",18.00,Southwest_France,Red_Blend
"Dominated by Sémillon, this is a rich, oily textured wine, full on and ripe. The wine has great flavors of apples, thyme, peppers, finishing with soft acidity.",18.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"A strongly tannic wine, tough at the edges. The core is more juicy, with black cherry as well as bitter chocolate, bringing out spice, pepper and a layer of wood. The finish shows more berry fruit characters.",18.00,Southwest_France,Syrah
"This is fruity Beaujolais with a sense of structure. It has a red cherry flavor that's laced with lively acidity, making this juicy and very drinkable. At the same time, the light tannins add a food-friendly element.",14.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"Towards the dry end of the Pinot Blanc spectrum, this is a crisp, citrus-driven wine. It has fine acidity and a simple, open, fruity character. The texture is rich and well balanced. Screwcap",12.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"Because of the extended elevage carried out at Guigal, the company's releases are always behind the market as a whole. Despite a tough vintage, this is an elegant, silky-textured wine, with complex notes of green olive, raspberry and cracked pepper.",75.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"This wine delivers all you could want from a Southern Rhône white, from its ample weight in the mouth to its deft combination of melon, citrus and wet stone. Finishes long and mouthwatering. Drink over the next 6–9 months.",16.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"Viognier from the Southern Rhône can often be overripe and heavy, but while this offering from Grand Veneur is full bodied and richly textured, it remains reasonably fresh. Apricot, pineapple and passion fruit flavors mingle easily on the palate, finishing clean and long. Drink now.",25.00,Rhône_Valley,Viognier
"From the Gonnets of Font de Michelle in Châteauneuf-du-Pape, this is the family's entry-level wine from an estate in the southern part of the Côtes du Rhône. The medium-bodied raspberry fruit is accented by hints of cracked pepper, dried spices and leather. It's supple enough to drink now and over the next 4–5 years.",15.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Full-bodied and muscular without being overblown, this wine showcases slightly lifted, plummy fruit, accented by licorice and black pepper. It's a bit warm on the finish but spicy and nuanced as well. Drink now–2020.",20.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Laurence Féraud's selections (her family owns Domaine de Pégaü in Châteauneuf-du-Pape) for her négociant line, like this Séguret, often represent excellent values. This is a full-bodied, velvety wine filled with notes of kirsch and Mexican chocolate. The finish is warm and comforting, and like a thick blanket, it would be a welcome sight this winter.",22.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"An excellent introduction to the wines of Cornas, this is a gently structured example, but one that shows ample complexity. Coffee, herb and green olive notes intertwine with a smoky, bacon-like element. An espresso note and soft tannins linger on the finish. Drink now–2020.",48.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"This is straw colored with a bright hue. Passion fruit, guava, honey, hazelnut and glue surface on the moderately aromatic nose. Crisp despite its full-bodied palate, the wine's alcohol is generous but well-balanced. The attack is resolutely dry and creates a pleasant and lightly rugged texture across the midpalate. The medium finish has well-concentrated fruit and a hazelnut undertone, suggesting a fine effort.",17.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,White_Blend
"Full and fat mousse over peachy fruit, acidity and an earthy character. This sparkling wine from Provence finishes with some crushed strawberry sweetness.",17.00,France_Other,Sparkling_Blend
"As a contrast to Jonathan Maltus's Le Carré, this single-vineyard wine, from vines situated only 100 yards away, has a taut, mineral flavor, with an initial austere character which then opens out to give dark bitter chocolate and plum skin flavors. It is potentially a richer, more impressive wine, but it needs aging for 4–5 years.",135.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The second property owned by the Latrille family of Château Jolys, Jurque has produced a fruity wine, lightly sweet, emphasizing a fruit salad of flavors, with fresh acidity as dominant as sweetness. A delicious apéritif style of wine.",23.00,Southwest_France,White_Blend
"Soft and creamy, this has good intensity of flavor. Ripe pear and red apple flavors introduce a soft, rounded texture and a rich, ripe finish. Screwcap.",15.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"This medium-sweet wine is attractively perfumed, with a good balance between exotic spice and fragrant acidity. The wine is soft and immediately drinkable. Screwcap.",14.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"This is an impressive effort from a co-op in the Gard. Black olive, coffee and blackberry notes suggest a healthy proportion of Syrah in the blend. It's a bit stern at first, but ends on a long, richly tannic note.",21.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Visan is a village that can produce some ageworthy wines, and this looks to be in that same mold, with firm tannins framing blackberry and black olive flavors. Give it another year or two, then drink it over the next 5–6.",26.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A mineral-driven wine, this is structured and firmly tannic. It has weight and concentration along with wood and blackberry flavors. Very concentrated, age this for another two years.",11.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"Full bodied and densely packed, this is a solid, cellar-worthy Gigondas that needs time to unfold. Right now, the aromas are slightly reticent, the chocolate and plum notes only slowly unfurling on the palate. Try 2014–2020.",50.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A surprisingly strong effort from Ogier, this is marked by dark, earthy notes of espresso, black olives and blackberries. Drink this full-bodied, slightly chewy wine over the next few years. Imported by Classic Wines of California and Vinum International.",15.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"For a Vacqueyras, this is rather charming and supple, with slightly jammy black-cherry notes balanced by mouth-watering acidity. Hints of leather and anise add a welcome note of complexity. Drink it over the next few years.",22.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This is a lightweight, refreshing rosé, with charming aromas and flavors of crushed stone, tart cherries and fresh limes and a crisp, citrusy finish. Drink it up before winter.",12.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah-Grenache
"From a vineyard planted with almost 7,000 vines per acre, and with low yields (2 bunches) per vine, you would expect concentration. And the wine is hugely perfumed, very aromatic, the fruit flavored with essence of green plum and grapefruit juice. It's the sort of wine that needs at least 3–4 years aging.",99.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A rich and beautiful wine with a lush, full weight and velvety texture. Typical black fruit abounds with accents of milk chocolate, thyme and eucalyptus. A hint of grapefruit oil adds vibrancy to the nose, transcending a more traditional Corbières offering. The finish is long and lingering but a bit tight with strong tannic presence; drink 2010 on. Only 50 cases imported.",42.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Aromas of perfumed wood, with the wood tannins persisting on the palate. The wine needs to lose its wood dominance to allow the fruit to come through. There is enough rich black currant flavor for this to happen in the next 2–3 years.",20.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Plenty of dry Malbec tannins here. In fact, this verges on the austere, piling high on to the fruit. There is density, those tannins going right through the wine, finishing with acidity. Tough at this stage: give it 2–3 years.",15.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"This is a light wine, attractively fruity with peach and apricot flavors. Intense acidity gives a fine kick to the texture, while also showing a dry, citrus-dominated side. Ready to drink.",14.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"The aromas are warm and spicy. On the palate, there is a herbal character along with smooth red plum fruit and a toast note. It is rich while still preserving a light touch and acidity on the finish.",18.00,Provence,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This is a broad, mouthcoating blend of Grenache Blanc, Roussanne, Clairette and Bourboulenc. Apricot, tangerine and honey notes dominate the palate, finishing long and just a bit warm. Opt for drinking it over the next 6–9 months.",45.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"Despite containing 50% Viognier, this is a restrained Côtes du Rhône white, with subtle citrus and wet stone shadings and a refined, medium-weight mouthfeel. It finishes well, with plenty of length and hints of citrus and honey. Drink it over the next year or two.",19.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"Forward and fruity, this is already developing its black plum fruit. The wine has a ripe, juicy and seemingly sweet character. With its supporting tannins, this should be ready to drink in 1–2 years.",17.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"A very drinkable Saint-Joseph, with bouncy, bright berry character and hints of smoke and asphalt. It's medium bodied and crisp, with only a touch of silky-textured tannin.",50.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"This is an attractive wine, with fruit and firm, supporting tannins. It has a mint flavor and a smooth texture, balanced with damson fruit. This is ripe and ready to drink over the next year.",20.00,Southwest_France,Malbec-Merlot
"Yes, this wine comes from a village of Chardonnay in the Mâcon region of Burgundy. It's a typical, crisp, freshly green Chardonnay that zings on to the palate. No wood here, just light grapefruit and citrus flavors, rounded with a touch of apple. Screwcap.",16.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Appropriately big and burly, full of ripe fruit, rather soft as well as rich. With its yellow fruits, layers of white currants and a powerful wood element, this is a wine that is still knitting together. There is potential here, especially from the underlying acidity. Give it 4–5 years.",120.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A wonderfully firm wine, which balances extraction with pure sweet fruit. It moves comfortably within its tannic structure, the ripe Merlot allowed plenty of play to show off its black jelly and plum flavors.",150.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This supple, medium-bodied wine packs in many of the notes that make Syrah from the Northern Rhône so compelling: coffee, tar, leather, black olive, chocolate and roasted meat, all backed by raspberry-cherry fruit. Enjoy the ride over the next several years.",26.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Cairanne is said to be in line to become the Rhône's next cru, and this wine is a solid example. It artfully marries fruit and spice in a medium-bodied wine with suple tannins and suprisingly crisp acids. Drink now–2018.",26.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A full-bodied wine that shows some warm-vintage effects in its aromas and flavors of stewed prunes, mocha, leather and chocolate. It's mouthfilling and a bit warm on the finish. Drink now–2017.",36.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"It's an unusual blend, but it works, creating a round, supple wine for immediate enjoyment. Hints of orange peel, coriander and green olive bring complexity to notes of plum and cherry, while the finish turns dark and espresso-like.",10.00,France_Other,Merlot-Grenache
"At only 10% Syrah, this is quite different in composition from most of Delas's wines. The rest is Grenache, and in 2009 the result is slightly pruny, with touches of coffee, chocolate and Christmas spice. It's full bodied and creamy in texture without being soft, thanks to the crisp acids and silky tannins on the finish. Drink it over the next few years.",46.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"The owner of Château de Fuissé in Pouilly-Fuissé makes a ripe, soft, fresh green and yellow fruit-flavored white Burgundy. There is a light touch of oak, the aftertaste is crisp and soft.",16.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This fairly rich and heavy rosé is produced and bottled for Xavier Flouret by Domaine de Rimauresq. It does have attractive peach and melon aromas, but the flavors are weighty in the mouth and could use a touch more zest and zip on the finish. Best with meaty dishes. A blend of 45% Cinsault, 25% Tibouren, 25% Grenache and 5% Syrah.",21.00,Provence,Rosé
"A powerfully ripe, toasty wine, showing all the richness of 2005 in Chablis, and adding a layer of structure to go with the apples and cream richness. At the center, there is green minerality.",88.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"The first vintage of this experimental, 7,000 vines per acre wine. An intense, dense wine, all the herbaceous, mineral character of Sauvignon Blanc is magnified with orange zest, touches of pear skin and a steely acidity.",99.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Jammy and ripe, from gravel soils in the valley plain of Saint-Emilion, this is already a very drinkable wine. It has intense, concentrated red and black berry fruits surrounding a core of seriously dry tannins from fruit and wood. Solid but rich, this is developing well.",50.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Produced from a small acre of land in Margaux, this is made in the same extravagant style as the cult wines of Saint-Emilion. With 100% new wood, it is definitely modern in style, but there is sufficient concentration in the fruit to balance all that vanilla. It misses the 2006 freshness,but everything else is there.",40.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Very much in the food style of Bordeaux, this wine shows the freshness of the 2006 vintage, while also offering some ripe weight. Flavors of fresh black currants edged with black plum skin are supported by a firm line of tannins, finished with a sweet, juicy, fleshy aftertaste.",30.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A 50/50 blend of wood-aged Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon from selected wines. It is wood-dominated at present, but the fruit feels rich enough to come through shortly, and then it will be an impressively ripe, structured wine. However, it's always going to be a dry, dark and firmly tannic.",40.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The local cooperative's entry-level VDN features a soft, velvety texture and notes of chocolate, almond and dark plum. A bit of warmth shows through on the finish.",20.00,Rhône_Valley,Grenache
"Really sweet and unctuous in texture, this pale copper-hued Muscat is a blend of white- and dark-skinned grapes. Peach and berry flavors are balanced by a spicy, green-herb tinge to the finish.",28.00,Rhône_Valley,Muscat
"Light and fruity, this has honey, spice and tangerine flavors. It is smooth, rounded and rich; age for 2–3 years.",13.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"As pale in color as is possible for a rosé, this is bright, crisp and fruity.It has delicious acidity and red apple and citrus flavors, with a burst of red currant on the finish.",18.00,Provence,Rosé
"Despite some tough tannins on the finish, this is an intriguingly complex wine that may prove even better than this rating suggests. It starts with a garrigue note and a hint of tapenade, then adds bright cherry fruit and plenty of dusty tannins. Drink 2014–2020.",45.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Starts with raspberry and cherry aromas and a dusty, earthy note that adds complexity and character. You can sense the warmth of the vintage in the glass, with slightly raisined notes that come through on the palate alongside the supple tannins. Drink it over the next few years.",25.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"The highly aromatic nose is vaguely suggestive of cotton candy, but the flavors are dry and precise, offering hints of white chocolate and white peach and ending on a citrusy note.",15.00,Rhône_Valley,Rosé
"Powerful wine, structured with apple skin tannins, layers of ripe, spicy toast and a taut, mineral character. There is something of the Meursault richness here, in the full white fruit flavors, but this is also a wine that needs to age.",93.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Grapefruit, toast and white peach aromas give this wine a great start. It is not powerful but is deliciously balanced with fresh green plum and pink grapefruit flavors rounded out with just the perfect amount of wood. Drink 2010.",48.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is a terrific Chardonnay from Limoux, an area more typically known for its Blanquette (which uses the Mauzac grape) but certainly not limited to it. It's a ripe and rich wine, loaded with aromas of red apple, nectarine pit, and almond milk. The mouth shows a bit more vibrancy with flavors of lime essence backed by honeydew. Round and fantastically balanced, with a long finish kissed by toasted oak.",15.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"This Chardonnay shows a beautiful minerality supported by rich and pronounced flavors of cantaloupe, wood-grilled peaches and smokey roasted almonds. It's medium weight and lush in the mouth, with a long evolving finish. Drink while it's still got some chill to it, as the alcohol is a bit too pronounced after warming too much.",27.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"A dense, rich wine, showing layers of black plum and berry fruits, topped with dry tannins and ripe acidity. This is a firm wine that shows good richness and balance, the wood element present but already well integrated.",28.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"With a slightly chemical smell, this is an intensely spicy, relatively dry wine. It's not abundant in acidity and freshness, so drink soon.",17.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"There is some of the structure characteristic of 2010 Beaujolais in this wine, but it is mainly dominated by a red cherry flavor and fresh acidity. It's ripe, fruity and ready to drink.",14.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"Intense herbal and green flavors are balanced by an array of white fruits, touches of pears, currants, white peaches, and a nutty character which rounds out the taut character of the fruits and tannins. Very concentrated acidity to finish.",55.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Soft, ripe and balanced, this is already a delicious wine. The grapefruit edge to the fruit gives it considerable freshness, but there are also flavors of white fruits, just leavened by toast. To finish, the acidity just bounces out of the glass.",110.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A terrific example of Corbières terroir at an unbeatable price. The wine, a traditional Rhône-style blend of Syrah, Grenache and Carignan, is so loaded with aromas and flavors of the surrounding garrigue you might think that they threw in a bouquet garni during maturation. Sage, rosemary,menthol, thyme and bay leaves all abound while rich, dark fruit and oak aging (Élevé en Fûts de Chêne means aged in oak barrels) provides support and structure. Silky texture, approachable tannins and a long finish bring it all together.",13.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Dark and concentrated, with aromas of kirsch, blackberry, carnation, sage and menthol. The medium weight mouthfeel shares the same flavors as the nose, but are supported by notes of mocha and sousbois. Needs some time to open up in the glass if enjoyed now; otherwise, hold until 2010–2012.",69.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A densely tannic wine initially, but then one that broadens out with spice, sweet wood and fresh black currant fruits. The base wine of the Berthoumieu range, this is still a powerful statement.",15.00,Southwest_France,Red_Blend
"Dark and intense, with notes of roasted meat, plum and black olive that give way to an espresso note and chalky tannins on the finish. Pretty stern stuff, which just means you'll want to give it another year or two before drinking it over the next 5–6 years.",15.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This is fresh and citrusy, with melony fruit and ample weight on the palate but also enough backbone to keep the flavors taut and focused. Drink it over the next year or so.",20.00,Rhône_Valley,White_Blend
"Full and ripe, certainly as befits Meursault from a great year, but this wine also has deliciously crisp acidity which adds an element of minerality, of poise, to the smooth toast and cream texture. An enticing, structured wine.",80.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Smooth, ripe and immediate, this is a wine that is developing deliciously, but fast. There is a great fresh, juicy character that balances with the ripe, full tannins. Don't age, just enjoy.",47.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A wine that is dominated by big, dense tannins. The black currant fruits come through with a stalky character. As it opens in the mouth, the wine shows some richness, along with its tannins, a hint of wood giving a smooth, elegant edge to the finish. It does need aging—four to five years.",28.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Ripe red raspberry notes, accented by cocoa, a chalky minerality and a hint of orange zest liven up the medium weight. With ample acidity and strong tannins, this wine will only improve with some time; you can tell that it's holding back and there's so much more that hasn't fully developed. Try it now or hold for 5–6 years.",22.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"As crisp as can be, with lemon and the greenest of apples, with a layer of taut fruit skins. Bright and breezy. Screwcap.",10.00,Southwest_France,Ugni_Blanc-Colombard
"Even at their lightest, the wines of Luc de Conti have great style. This fruity, red cherry and spice wine is bright, fresh, with just the right layer of tannins. The finish is firm, but without losing the fruit.",15.00,Southwest_France,Merlot
"A good pair with the Colombard and Ugni Blanc blend from the same producer, this is a tight, bright, very crisp wine. There is no missing the acidity, but the wine has a freshness that is infectious. Drink as a great apéritif. Screwcap.",11.00,Southwest_France,White_Blend
"This has a soft texture and an attractive apple flavor, with light acidity. Bright and fruity, it's ready to drink, just hinting at pepper and spice on the finish. Screwcap.",14.00,Alsace,White_Blend
"This négociant bottling delivers reasonably fresh fruit and plenty of ripe raspberry flavor. It's medium to full in body, with supple tannins that make it easy to drink now.",36.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"The bright nose leads with aromas of crushed granite, damp forest floor and baked boysenberry cobbler drizzled with cassis liqueur. This is medium-bodied, with integrated alcohol and very little glycerol. This robust red has focused acidity and pleasantly tugging, broad tannins. Squeaky-clean fruit and smart winemaking make this a curiously rambunctious yet polished wine.",12.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Combine prune, leather and spice notes with firm tannins and the result is a slightly rustic, old-school expression of Vacqueyras. It's concentrated and characterful, with up to a decade of aging potential.",37.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A fortified blend of Tannat and Malbec, this is a ripe and sweet, styled like a vintage Port. It has a powerful structure from the two tannic grapes in the blend, along with ripe damson fruit and spice, with acidity on the finish.",24.00,France_Other,Red_Blend
"Young to taste, this wine is hardly ready to show its full fruit and rounded green flavors. Yet it's possible to tell that this is going to be impressively rich but crisp, the acidity a telling adjunct to the perfumed concentration and pear skin flavors.",35.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A foursquare wine, all angles and edges, that still needs time to soften and open. It is going to be rich and delicious, hinting at white currants, pears and green plum skins. The minerality and vegetal edge is there as well. An impressive wine from this ancient property.",35.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"With 250 cases imported, this Reserve is easier to acquire, half the price and almost as satisfying as the brand's Limited Release offering. Loaded with influence of the surrounding garrigue, including bay leaves and sage, aromas and flavors of black cherries, plum skin, violets and tar also abound. Velvety in texture and full in the mouth with a long, evolving finish that ends on a divine mocha note.",21.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Rich and structured, this is a sturdy wine that shows good dry fruit tannins as well as wood. The blackberry fruit is open, ripe, giving a good juicy character and depth of flavor. This is a wine for 2–3 years' aging.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This is Barton & Guestier's home vineyard and, in 2006, it has produced a finely crafted wine. The balance is all there, with ripe red berry fruits and cranberry juice adding to the firm, dark core of tannins. It is worth aging  for two to three years but is certainly drinkable now.",25.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"With its high percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon (60%), this gives an initial serious structure, topped with rich, ripe black fruit flavors. The tannins are calmed by this richness, with spice, blueberries and blackberry juice much more dominant.",65.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This top cuvée from Château Cadillac has great fresh black currant fruits, dark plum skins and sweet tannins. It is also very obviously aged in wood, and this element needs to calm down. Wait another year, or decant now.",16.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Rich, solid, with ripe spice and black plum flavors. The considerable richness is balanced with dark tannins, which give a sense of fine-grained texture to this solid wine.",16.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A fresh wine, with pure fruit, plum and light cherry flavors and a burst of acidity. The tannins have a firm chewy character but are minor players in this fruity wine. Screwcap.",11.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"A pale rosé in color, this light and fruity wine has a fresh raspberry flavor, with a zingy texture that gives attractive acidity. It's light and creamy, hinting at yeastiness on the finish.",25.00,Alsace,Pinot_Noir
"This is atypically medium bodied for the warm 2009 vintage, with an admirable degree of lightness and drinkability. Tart berry fruit is accented by rose hips and orange zest, then finishes crisp and lingering. Drink it over the next several years.",16.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A blend of Cabernet Franc and Tannat, this is spicy, smoky and herbal. It is dense, with a green, stalky edge that comes from the acidity and black tannins. Age for two years.",24.00,Southwest_France,Red_Blend
"Full bodied and thickly textured, this Southern Rhône Syrah combines cedar and vanilla notes from oak aging with notes of brandied cherries and a bit of asphalt. It's long on the finish, with a plush feel, then ends on a slightly bitter note.",50.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"A fresh, appealing example of Gigondas, with mouth-watering cherry fruit that's blissfully uncomplicated yet satisfying for its verve and intensity. A hint of cocoa sneaks in on the finish. Drink it over the next few years.",23.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Structured and firm, this is a solid, chunky wine. With its black fruit flavors merging with a more dry and tannic core, it is both dense and ageworthy. Acidity leavens its rich character. Age for 3–4 years.",13.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This is has flavors of apple and red currant, with a dry, light touch. The acidity cuts through the palate, giving it an attractive freshness, with a touch of spice and a crisp finish.",19.00,Provence,Rosé
"Beautifully concentrated aromas precede flavors of violets, pepper, sweet spice, plum and red berries. The wine is full and round in the mouth with excellent acidity and tannin. A little tight and closed right now, it should open up to be even more balanced and better integrated in 2–3 years.",38.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"An interesting, exotic wine, complex and layered. Butter,cream and caramel underlie apricot aromas while the intense palate shows peach, poached pear and lemon notes. One wishes the butter and toasted bread flavors on the finish would linger just a bit longer.",21.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"With its flavor that edges toward oxidative, this is the antithesis of easy, fruity white Bordeaux. That makes it an edgy, exciting wine, with spice, ginger and lychee flavors adding to the caramel wood over green plums.",83.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"A ripe and rich wine with black cherry, strawberry, lilac and rosemary notes on the nose. The mouth is full with a satiny texture and hints of tea leaves, structured by firm tannins and medium acidity. Aged in French oak for 12 months, it has a long and evolving finish marked by a lovely vanilla note.",17.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Fresh toast and citrus aromas indicate a wine that is both full-bodied and balanced. The wood is very evident at this stage, giving a firm, toasty character. There are white peaches and citrus flavors, and long-lasting, refreshing acidity to finish.",132.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"There's good concentration in this ripe, rounded Sauvignon style wine, with white fruit flavors just touched by the crispness of green skins. The wine revels in the density of texture, while keeping a deft touch of freshness. Age for 2–3 years to be at its best.",27.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"White fruits and delicious soft acidity make this wine immediately attractive. It is rich and fresh at the same time, with just a touch of apple skin structure. The name of the wine refers to the Solutré rock which towers over the vineyards.",25.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A young, fruity wine that boasts layers of the freshest, bright red berry fruits allied to dusty tannins. It is made to be drunk young, a vivid fruity wine, lively and fresh.",12.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"With three years' age, this is developing into an attractive lemon and honey style of wine, with a core of dry botrytis. It could age another two years.",18.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"An intensely herbaceous wine, its very fresh acidity a part of the juicy currants, gooseberry and grapefruit flavors. It is light, fresh, a fine apéritif wine.",12.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"This tastes soft and almost off-dry, despite its brut label. The flavors are of off-ripe apple, creamed pear and a light taste of acidity. It's all fine and in balance, it just misses vivacity and freshness.",40.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Buoyed by pleasant black-plum fruit and healthy doses of licorice and peppery spice, this sturdy, medium-bodied wine may lack a little charm but ticks all the other boxes, ending long and balanced. Drink now–2018.",21.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A ripe and spicy blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this has ripe black fruits that are laced with firm, dry tannins. There is a herbal character that gives it an edge.",20.00,Provence,Red_Blend
"The wine continues the rise in quality of whites from this producer. It is refined, elegant, not powerful, but with a great balance between wood and fruit, and a long, lingering green fruit aftertaste.",34.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A light, floating style, pierced with minerality and crisp green apple skin flavors. There is wood, but it is only just noticeable. With its structure and tense fruit, this is likely to age well: give it 5–8 years.",65.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Deliciously fresh, this is almost delicate, certainly elegant. There is great balance here, the wood just lightly toasty over the smooth, creamy white fruit flavors. For a wine from a lesser Burgundy appellation, this is impressive.",45.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is a wine that is about tropical fruits, softness and ripeness. It is definitely full-bodied, needing to show its structure, but the spice, toast and yellow fruit flavors are all immediately attractive.",75.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Dominated by new wood, this wine has not yet found its true character. It will likely become rich and juicy, with black plum and spice flavors coming forward in 2–3 years. For the moment, it is all about firmness and dryness.",34.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A fresh, juicy, ripe wine, bursting with new red and black berry fruits. The wine is plush, forward and fruity, a wine to drink young and still vibrant.",11.00,Southwest_France,Tannat-Cabernet
"Very fresh, crisp and green, packed with the crispest apples and lime zest. The Colombard adds a perfume of warm apricot skins, while the acidity and weight come from the Ugni Blanc.",11.00,Southwest_France,Ugni_Blanc-Colombard
"A light wine, the tannins stalky and chewy, but with fresh red berry fruits and no sign of wood. There is an attractive juicy acidity to go with the dry edge of tannins.",13.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This earthy, light-weight wine has wild strawberry flavor along with citrus-driven acidity that gives the red fruits a taut quality. Tannins and a dry edge suggest it needs a few more months before drinking.",26.00,Alsace,Pinot_Noir
"A white fruit note leads this wine on a rich, spice-strewn path. The acidity cuts into the richness, putting the slightly oxidative character into perspective. With its rich, yeasty character, it's fit for drinking now.",25.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"The Perrin family's line of négociant wines includes this reliable white, which features melon and pineapple aromas and flavors, medium body and a clean, reasonably crisp finish. Drink it over the next six months.",11.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"This is a soft wine that is full in the mouth, with a raspberry purée flavor and soft acidity. It's round with a depth of red fruit flavor and a warm finish.",15.00,Provence,Rosé
"Shows pleasant Northern Rhône Syrah notes of raspberry and cherry, even if it's not particularly textured or complex. The fruit is crisp and forward, with sufficient tannins to ably partner burgers or steaks. Drink it over the next few years.",22.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Fine ripe fruit, with citrus acidity and ripe, soft opulent yellow fruits. The acidity and wood give the wine structure, but the main parts of this wine are its richness and softness.",75.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Once principally known for its reds, Domaine Vacheron's whites are increasingly important. This 2006 domaine wine is ripe, with intense mineral flavors and pink grapefruit which edges to tannins and green apple skins. Classic Sauvignon Blanc, very pure.",30.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Classic Sauvignon, steely, crisp and mineral. There is a concentration of texture and green skins as well as impressive freshness. Lively, vibrant flavors, vivid in their relief, point up the good intensity of this fruity wine.",27.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Moderately intense menthol, black licorice and African violets aromas on the nose. The mouth, full of ripe plum and dark cherries accented by notes of cocoa and fresh mint leaves, has a lovely balance and silky texture. Ends on a somewhat simple yet clean finish.",11.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A sexy nose with nuances of mineral, pear and apricot cut by high floral tones leads to a crisp, more straightforward palate with a lush texture. Moderate acidity makes it a good choice for consuming without food. A dollar or two more than its competitors and worth every penny.",13.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Viognier
"A fresh, warmly herbaceous wine, with a hint of apricot juice and sweet pink grapefruit. Bright acidity finishes a great apéritif wine.",10.00,Southwest_France,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A fresh wine, all berry flavors and ripe juiciness. It's a wine to be drunk young, just touched by tannins. Delicious and fruity.",14.00,Southwest_France,Duras
"A wine that seems to have come from over-ripe fruit, with an awkward juicy character piercing the dry tannins. Acidity is there over the blackberry fruits.",17.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"A hard-edged wine, lean and mineral in character. It has a juicy tartness to it, the berry fruits surrounding a curiously hollow center.",22.00,Southwest_France,Red_Blend
"Offering uncomplicated, easy drinking, this Grenache-Syrah blend is lush and immediately accessible, displaying the charm of the 2011 vintage. Drink it over the next year or two for its gulpable cherry and chocolate flavors.",9.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This négociant based in the Northern Rhône has turned out a meaty, savory Châteauneuf-du-Pape. It's full bodied and firmly structured, with plenty of clove, leather and peppered beef. Drink 2014–2020.",60.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"An odd, menthol note runs through this wine, giving the bright cherry fruit a slightly medicinal edge. It's slightly creamy in texture, with a hint of chocolate on the warm finish.",35.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This is a smooth, orange- and peach-flavored wine, with a rich almost oily texture. It's rounded with light acidity on the finish. With its weight, this is a wine for food.",20.00,Provence,Viognier
"A blend of 50% Roussanne, 40% Viognier and 10% Clairette, this is a full-bodied Southern Rhône that somehow manages to retain aromas of wet stone and crisp, zesty flavors of melon and pear. Drink it over the next several months.",15.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"This intriguing wine is dominated by the 60% of normally rare Petit Verdot. Made by the same team as Château Paloumey, this wine shows an impressive color, and a rich, black berry juicy character. The tannins are solid, but the exuberant fruit overrides everything else.",32.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Chocolate and bitter cherries dominate this full-on wine, packed with spice and toasty wood flavors. In mouthfeel, it is very rich, smooth, dense and velvety at the same time.",13.00,Bordeaux,Merlot
"Velvety textured and full in weight with moderate tannic presence, this wine is powerful while remaining immediately approachable. Black cherry, blueberry, menthol and iris aromas lead into the palate of stewed red berries, pepper and eucalyptus leaves. A lingering finish of muted thin mint closes beautifully.",13.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Allspice and black raspberries lead off the nose, followed by flavors of juicy plum and thyme on the palate. Accents of milk chocolate and earth add complexity to the otherwise straightforward selection. Nicely balanced with a strong, sweet-spice, lingering finish.",16.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Initially very mineral, this wine opens up to soft, creamy toast and vanilla flavors. The acidity is crisp but sweet, hinting at yellow fruits and then showing off pears. The finish is all about freshness.",39.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Initially, this appears gentle and creamy; only later does acidity and green pear skin structure come in. Full and plump, with soft white fruits, the wood is prominent at this stage.",24.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A soft, unfocussed wine that certainly shows the black color of Malbec, from which comes the name of the wine. But it lacks definition, the wood element separate from the ripe berry fruits, with acidity trailing behind.",11.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"In a light, fresh style, this is an attractive red berry fruited wine. There are light tannins, soft strawberry flavors and a light acidity.",11.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This is perfumed and lemony, almost to the point of resembling furniture polish. It's pleasantly silky in texture, but the recurring notes of white pepper and citrus become somewhat one-dimensional and slightly bitter on the finish.",30.00,Rhône_Valley,Muscat
"A fresh-faced rosé, with a rose-grey color, this has red fruit acidity and an attractive, creamy character to go with the crisp finish.",18.00,Provence,Rosé
"This is an immediately accessible Châteauneuf-du-Pape, with moderately concentrated red fruit, leather and clove notes, crisp acids and just a hint of supple tannin on the finish. Drink it over the next several years.",39.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"An attractive, balanced, drinkable wine that is soft in texture, almost ready to drink now. The pure black currant fruits are fresh and bright, with light wood flavors.",30.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A perfumed, new wood-dominated wine, but one that does have the weight of fruit to support the wood. The tannins edge between fruit and wood, layered over rich black plums and bitter chocolate flavors. Under everything is fresh acidity to give the wine a welcome, vivid final lift.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A touch funky and green at first, that soon blows off to reveal a dark and wonderfully concentrated wine that shows some serious promise with age. Cassis, plum, black cherry, spice and tobacco fill the palate, with a long, smoky finish sealing the deal. Drink after 2010. Imported by The Portfolio Group.",36.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
"Ripe Merlot pushes through the tight tannins that are still evident in this wine. This dark, dry core dominates initially, and needs time to open up to show the vivid black currant flavors, touched with dried fruits and fresh finishing acidity.",30.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This juicy, fruit forward Grenache offers flavors of red plum, blueberries and licorice supported by notes of rosemary and roses in the background. Silky texture with ample tannin and acidity leads into a fairly long and nicely evolving finish. Excellent choice for red meat dishes. Imported by The Portfolio Group.",46.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Grenache
"An attractively balanced wine, full of ripe, warm fruit, but still keeping the acidity as a counterweight to the rich tropical and white fruit flavors. The wood shows, but the fruit powers through to give richness and some freshness.",38.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Heavy and glowering, this wine is powered with weight. The fruit is an afterthought, the white currants, green plums and acidity creeping in after all the density of structure has softened. Wood to finish.",129.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Pears, apples and cream work well together in this friendly dry white. It has a weight, ripeness, but the acidity gives a lift. The finish is soft and full in the mouth.",11.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Light, fresh, soft and already very drinkable. The initial taste is dominated by citrus, and then it rounds out, adding toast, green fruits and a definite sophistication for a simple white Burgundy.",59.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Crisp, green and steely, this is classic Chablis, all about pure green fruits and minerality, only lightly layered with wood. It is vibrant and fresh, with the acidity adding a mouthwatering lightness.",36.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Fresh, fruity, relatively lightweight, this offers immediately pleasurable drinking. Tannins give a counterpoint, but only play a minor role. For drinking over the next 2–3 years.",85.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Simple, clean, fresh, raspberry-flavored wine, with light acidity. There is an edge of apple and caramel, the aftertaste just off dry.",11.00,Southwest_France,Rosé
"Soft, almost sweet, with considerable caramel and sweet strawberry flavors. There is an awkward final bitterness.",13.00,Southwest_France,Rosé
"Interesting that despite being from a vintage so warm and sunny, this has an underripe tang to it. It delivers the spicy, feral notes of Muscat, but not the seductive perfume the grape is capable of producing.",19.00,Rhône_Valley,Muscat_Blanc_à_Petit_Grain
"The Grenache Blanc (60%) gives this wine its delicate aromas of white flowers, while the Clairette (40%) provides backbone and pineapple fruit. Drink this relatively soft, mouthfilling white over the next few months.",14.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"Intense wood aromas are coupled with white fruits. This has smoothed out the fruit, just hinting at peaches, and is more about the toast and spice. The aftertaste is full.",42.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Very grassy, herbaceous aromas lead to a wine that is dominated by minerality and pink grapefruit. It is intense, ripe and concentrated, but there is an element of tension in its crisp aftertaste.",25.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A toasty, oaky wine, with smoky aromas and flavors that mask the white fruit flavors and acidity. Hopefully all this high toast will burn off. Hold for 2–3 years.",30.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Strong aromas of new wood are confirmed by the palate, where wood flavors dominate. This is a structured wine, showing fruit acidity under the wood and sufficient weight of red berry fruits to come through in another six months.",19.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This toasty, superbly mature wine is part of a series of releases featuring the house's cellar-matured Champagnes. This emerges from the glass with complex flavors of almond, brioche, citrus and a hint of steeliness. The majestic richness of the wine has fully justified its decades of aging.",208.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"The most recent vintage release from Pol Roger is this superb 2002. Notes of apple, almond, citrus and a hint of toast mingle together effortlessly. It can be consumed now, especially with food, but its mixture of maturity and freshness promise to age beautifully for many years to come.",110.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
This very pale rosé has the richness of toast and croissant that comes from complete maturity. It also features fresh hints of the red and white fruits that were present during the wine's younger years. This is ready to drink now.,246.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is a thouroughbred, elegant sparkler. With its delicate acidity, apple and grapefruit flavors, and tense, steely texture, it is an extremely well-blanced wine. Although it is ready to drink now, it could certainly age in bottle for many years.",135.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"This herbaceous wine has a green note, with layers of citrus fruits and an orange zest texture that lends a bright, fruity character.",14.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"A surprisingly strong effort, Ogier's Heritage Blanc shows some intriguing notes of orange and mushroom on the nose, then follows up with plenty of heft on the palate and a long, citrusy finish. Drink it over the next several months.",12.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"This grand rosé is rich and rounded. Its red fruit flavors are layered with toast and spice notes, with depth that gives the wine another dimension of complexity. It could age in the bottle for at least 3–4 years.",235.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This shimmers with its flavors of apple and lime, its hint of toast and its soft finish. It's finely balanced, a great selection that is ready to drink now.",144.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"The Spécial Club is a grouping of Champagne producers who taste each other's wines before allowing them to be released under this label. With its pure expression of mineral-driven, tense Chardonnay, this is made in a dry style. It's fragrant, fruity and ready to age for several years.",85.00,Champagne,Chardonnay

"With just the right amount of toasty age, this is gorgeous. Its strawberry note is woven into its rich texture, with a flavor of fresh croissant and a final burst of acidity. It could age, but why wait?",350.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is an impressively rich nonvintage selection, with tropical fruit as well as a mineral-driven character. It's impressive and would certainly take more bottle aging.",44.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"The latest release of the legendary Comtes de Champagne comes from a great vintage. It has full, toasty bottle-age notes that give the wine depth of flavor, with a ripe, rounded mouthfeel and taut acidity. An almond note combines with the citrus-driven acidity on the finish.",171.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"The structure is present as is the bright black-currant fruit. It has some richness, although it is tempered with acidity and a stalky character. Age for 2–3 years.",15.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Modest leather, spice and black plum notes lead into a wine that's plump and dark fruited, not especially complex, but mouthfilling. The acids seem a touch low, so consume this soft, charming wine over the next few years.",18.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend

"This is top Champagne from Piper-Heidsieck, offering the delicious airy quality that's the hallmark of this house, with crisp apple flavor, tangy acidity and the first signs of yeasty, toasty bottle age.

"This is a beautiful, ripe, full-bodied sparkler, balancing rich fruit with bottle age to produce a round, elegant character. It is delicious to drink now, although there is enough fruit to allow it to age for 2–3 years.",140.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"It's rare to find a nonvintage blend with such attractive bottle age; in most the fruitiness dominates. This has a toasty character, with an almond note and a ripe mouthfeel that balances its warm pear and yellow-fruit flavors. This demonstrates a full, rich style.",60.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is made in a deeper, richer style than this producer's nonvintage. It has weight and concentration, and its acidity is balanced by the ripe orange and red apple flavors that are cut by a steely edge. On the finish, acidity and fruit come deliciously together.",75.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend

"This is a lightly sweet wine made from superripe Gros Manseng and Sauvignon Blanc. It has apricot, raisin and pineapple flavors along with some yeastiness. A fine apéritif wine.",12.00,Southwest_France,White_Blend

"Soft but minerally, this wine has a touch of initial austerity, while the fruit tastes green with a tannic edge. You can feel the green skins as the wine moves on to lime and crispness. There is a touch of pepper to finish.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"An intense wine that reveals its floral and rich character slowly. It is showing only a slight sign of maturity, and more noticeable are its flavors of crisp apple and citrus, along with bright, tight acidity. It could age well for several more years.",300.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"While 2005 is not a great vintage in Champagne, in the right hands, as here, it can produce some fine wines. This is beautifully balanced, a contrast between soft fruit and a touch of maturity. It is not a wine for long aging, and will be completely ready in a year.",74.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend

The palate is full and ripe, with powerful, dense black-fruit and berry flavors that are laced with a hint of cream and sweet cocoa. Firm yet well-integrated tannins grip the long finish. Decadent now, but should hold nicely through 2017.",150.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Red_Blend
"In this case, Sous Bois, which is French for “under wood,” refers to the wine's first fermentation in wood. This creates an extra dimension of richness, with a slight sense of oxidation. At the same time, the fruit feels lifted and open.",82.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is an ultra­rich, full and elegant selection. It's intense and concentrated, a serious wine that speaks of its fine depth of flavor and weight. Now ready to drink.",148.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is Pehu-Simonet's contrast with its Blanc de Noirs from the Montagne de Reims. It has the same dryness as that wine, but it features a more open character. There is, of course, minerality imparted from the chalk soil, which is balanced deliciously with an intense citrus flavor. Age for another year in bottle.",72.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"This is a beautifully balanced and elegant offering, with pleasant fruitiness, tight acidity and a fragrant, crisp character. It's full bodied, and falls in the middle of the brut spectrum of dryness. This is ready to drink now.",70.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This blend of 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah is atypically big and burly in 2009, showing some intense coffee and charcoal notes layered over black cherry fruit.

"Although not indicated on the label, this is a blanc de blancs. It veers toward bone dry, while maintaining just a hint of ripe tropical fruit to round out the crisp, mineral texture. It could age over several years.",67.00,Champagne,Chardonnay

"Dominated by Grenache, Magni's 2009 Sensation displays distinctive notes of pie cherry, stewed rhubarb, watermelon and cracked pepper. Medium to full in the mouth, it boasts exceptionally silky tannins. Tart and peppery on the finish but not at all unpleasant.",50.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This demi-sec (off dry) means there is some initial roundness that makes it more attractive young. But the underlying acidity and the green plum flavor, along with an edge of tannin, all suggest some aging ability. Drink now–2012.",16.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc

"From biodynamic producer Marcel Lapierre, this is probably as good as it got in 2007. It's a rich wine, concentrated, although the crisp fruits of the year tend to dominate. There are raspberry flavors, very pure, very fresh, but with some good depth of flavor.",30.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"An intensely perfumed wine, combining power and smooth elegance. The wood gives the perfume initially, but the fruit is not far behind, a ripe layer of sweet jelly flavors, bolstered by tannin. The aftertaste is fresh, bright, but still intense.",53.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"The classic Bollinger nonvintage is, as always, rich and firmly structured. With the roundness that comes from aging the wines in wood before blending, it has a ripe, smooth edge. Underneath, the texture is solid, with hints of apple and pear and mature acidity.",90.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Aged in wood before bottling, this is ripe and very full. Rather than add to the already-complex flavors, the wood has rounded it out.

"In perfect balance now, this is a great expression of mineral-driven Chardonnay. Its acidity is a vehicle for the crisp flavors of pear and lime, with a hint of ginger. It's still young, so drink it now for its great fruit, or age for four more years.",80.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"The pure Pinot gives a powerful character to this Champagne. There is terrific tension, producing a wine that is firmly structured, full of ripe flavors of white fruit and red apple skin. It's full bodied and dry in the Pehu-Simonet style.",72.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend

"A slightly chunky and inelegant Côtes du Rhône, this wine nevertheless delivers satisfying and assertive notes of black olive, espresso and dark chocolate. Drink it over the next few years.",12.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Light, fresh style, demanding shellfish, with crisp, green acidity and just a hint of creamy baked apple. Just what a Muscadet should be, enjoyable now and for the rest of the year.",12.00,Loire_Valley,Melon
"This ripe, full-bodied structured wine brings together good cherry and red berry flavors. It's a well-knit, dense wine with intense fruit.",14.00,Beaujolais,Gamay

"A soft, lightly herbaceous style, with good green apple and white currant flavors. Crisp, light, refreshing, drink this year.",11.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A light wine, somewhat unfocused and lacking fruit intensity. But it is certainly pleasant, clean and fresh, with a definite green tinge and a citrus aftertaste.",19.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc

"This ripe and fruity style shows yellow fruit and citrus, producing a full-bodied wine. With its weight and richness, it is a delicious wine to drink now, but this blend also shows potential for bottle aging.",85.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is definitely dry, yet it still retains the full, rich Vilmart style. Crisp, mineral-driven and taut in character, it features a fine mélange of apple, tangerine, light spice and intense citrus. Its texture suggests it needs to age at least three more years.",93.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Rich, ripe and full bodied, this is a warm, Chardonnay-dominated blend. It has crisp apple and citrus flavors, followed by a quince note and a touch of apricot. The fruit for this wine is sourced from premier cru vineyards, and it could age a few more months in bottle. Disgorged January 2012.",84.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend

"An impressively rich Sancerre red, showing plenty of red berry fruits, tight tannins and balanced acidity. Yes, it is not Burgundy, but in 2005 Sancerre could really justify its red wines, and this example, with delicacy and elegance, works well.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Pinot_Noir
"A wine for further aging. The wood element is powerful, but then so is the rich, jammy fruit. You can feel the weight, taste the extraction, the bitter chocolate character bursting out of the ripest blackberry fruit flavors. Keep for 2–3 years.",21.00,Southwest_France,Red_Blend
"Notes of toasted apple skins, wood-grilled peaches, lightly dried grass and sweet spices lead the nose of this attractive white and continue through onto the medium-weight palate. It is ripe and fruit-forward, with rounded flavors of melon, pear and apple flesh, but it's all lifted by marked, brisk acidity that keeps the finish simultaneously bright and long. Drink now–2015.",42.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Grenache_Gris
"This beautifully fragrant offering is definitely on the dry side. It has a crisp apple flavor, accompanied by a citrus note and taut minerality. This nervy, feather-light wine is better fit for food than as an apéritif. Still young, it could age for several more years.",65.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Attractively mature, this has a toast flavor that combines delicately with citrus and pineapple notes. Tight, crisp and textured, it is delicious and fragrant. This includes old Champagne varieties, including the unusual Arbanne and Petit Meslier.",82.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is dry, but not quite bone dry. The richness of the smooth Pinot Noir is enough to round out the crisp apple and lime flavors, giving it a wonderful brightness. It could be aged, though its freshness makes it drinkable now.",49.00,Champagne,Pinot_Noir
"Aÿ is better known for its Pinot Noir, so it's rare to find a blanc de blancs. Made in a rich style, it's full of grapefruit, citrus and apricot flavors. It balances this with taut, crisp acidity to produce a full wine that retains the dancing quality of a blanc de blancs.",55.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"If you are looking for wild flavors, then this wine is for you. It is dry, but smells sweet, with lychee, green candy and aromatic spices. It's a wine with a terrific character, needing cheeses and rich fish dishes to bring out its full potential.",20.00,Southwest_France,White_Blend
"Lightly perfumed, the wine then shows elegant concentration. It has ripe, vibrant fruit, but this is rounded by the finely judged wood. Over the fruit, there's a suave layer of wood giving a wine that has aging potential.",25.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"This is a dense and heady wine, with powerful aromas of forest berry, garrigue and purple flower that mingle seamlessly with the blackberry and raspberry fruit core. A hint of smoky game adds depth to the palate, which evolves in layers from notes of lush fruit flesh to tannic skins, then offering notes of savory herbs and, finally, a raw cocoa powder flavor. The texture is like crushed velvet.",45.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
"Produced from vineyards in Ludes on the Montagne de Reims, this is a rich selection. A good proportion of Pinot Noir creates ripe notes of apple and black currant, laced with intense, crisp acidity. It will take 1–2 years of bottle aging.",70.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"With zero dosage, this is obviously a very dry Champagne. But such is the richness of its fruit that it tastes ripe and rounded, allowing the citrus bite to fit well with the apple skin flavor. It could age a year.",56.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Seductively light in color, this is based on Pinot Noir. It has a fine balance and a touch of toast. The fresh red-fruit and citrus flavors harmonize into a complex whole. Like many Bollinger Champagnes, it's a delicious, full-bodied selection that's best suited for food.",110.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Ripe, earthy wine, with cherries, rhubarb and pronounced acidity. The tannins are young, touched by wood. This is a mineral style, somewhat austere, but still young. Serve lightly chilled.",38.00,Loire_Valley,Pinot_Noir

"Dominated by Merlot, but with sizable chunks of other Bordeaux grapes, this is finely polished, wood-aged wine. It has perfumed spice and dry tannins from the wood. The fruit balances well, showing wild blackberry and licorice. Age for 2–3 years.",21.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Loads of dark, jammy black-fruit flavors are graced with vanilla bean and sweet spice accents. Lush and mouthfilling without feeling overdone, the palate boasts intensely concentrated flavors of cherry and plum, with a touch of black pepper that unfolds on the slightly chewy, medium-length finish. Drink now–2015.",22.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend

"A ripe, rounded wine, with intense flavors of apple skins, pear and white peach, with just a hint of nut. Described as dry, this has some richness to balance the definite acidity, which gives a lift but certainly no hardness.",18.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Wood dominates both the aroma and the flavor of this wine. It's good wood, giving vanilla and smooth textures. It has softened the fruit, the fresh berry flavors sitting on a soft cushion of dusty tannins. It needs 2–3 years.",10.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"Layers of spicy wood add to the smooth, creamy character of this wine. It has vivid acidity lifted by green fruit skins and flavors of pineapple and grapefruit. There is a final perfume from the Muscadelle in the blend.",21.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Fresh Chardonnay, lightly warm but also tinged with acidity, citrus and pear flavors. Soft, creamy and friendly. Drink now.",16.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Simple, full and soft, with pleasant ripe apple fruits topped with mangoes. A perfumed character of rosehip leaves a full, lightly sweet aftertaste.",18.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"This 100% Pinot Noir bottling has weight and a sense of structure. It is dry and moderately tannic, with citrus and green apple flavors. It's a young, intensely textured wine, one that needs bottle aging for at least four years.",69.00,Champagne,Pinot_Noir
"A finely wrought wine, this is tangy and mineral driven, layering acidity, citrus and white fruit in a complex, elegant whole.",54.00,Champagne,Chardonnay

"With a strong, mousse-like feel in the mouth, this is a lively offering. It's yellow fruit is layered with toastiness. It has a rich feel, very much in the Billiot style, and a complex, compact character. It is ready to drink. Disgorged October 2011.",106.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Very dry and rich, this is a taut, tense bottling of Goutorbe's rosé. It has apple and red currant flavors, laced with intense acidity and a bright texture. With more bottle aging, it could be an apéritif wine. For now, it is best with food.",60.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Nut and toast aromas lead to a smooth palate, with creamed apple and delicate orange zest flavors. Behind the crisp acidity, there is a mature feel, giving roundness to the delicious aftertaste.",17.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"A classic in development, a wine that will last for decades. It is certainly powerful, but already the shape is finalized, with its plums and berries settling down with perfumes, acidity, just enough tannins and a warm, welcoming richness. A great argument for the superiority of 2001 over 2000.",190.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A wonderfully firm, concentrated wine that walks a fine, balanced line between richness and poised structure. It is classic in the best sense, showing all the shape of a fine Bordeaux, while adding the extra dimension of the freshest of black fruits, complexity from a few hints of wood, and a dark, brooding, long-lasting aftertaste.",90.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This is a marvelously complete wine, with its impressive ripe fruit, shining through the open structure. It is firm, but not too much. Stone black fruits are just perfectly ripe. There is just a core of dryness to compliment the rest of the wine.",60.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The completeness of 2001, with its miraculous balance, is present in this wine. The acidity, ripe blackcurrants sit comfortably on top of dry tannins, the fleshiness of the fruit taking the edge off the tannins. It seems to bring out the structure, the fruit and the refreshing acidity of great Cabernet.",80.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"There is a great link here between the tannins, delicious red berry fruits and blackcurrants and the almost architectural structure. The wine certainly has fine fruit, a great balance, very complete, finishing gently, ripe and soft.",54.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"What a perfumed, elegant, structured wine, with all the elements of fruit, wood, tannins just in the right place. It shows great tannins, powerful black and red berry fruits, denseness, and a classic, fresh aftertaste.",48.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Impressively dense, dark flavored wine, very rich and quite extracted. But it still keeps the elegance and some of the freshness of 2004, and there is plenty of blackberry flavor to push the wine along. Heavier than many 2004s, it still shows that great acidity.",70.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend

"A harmonious balanced wine, showing fine, fresh acidity. The tannins have closed in somewhat, but you can taste the chocolate, and the sweet character of the ripe fruit. At the end, the acidity gives a fine lift.",70.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Although it is relatively soft, this wine still has everything about it. There is ripeness, but it is balanced with fresh acidity still with an aura of youth. In the core, there are solid blackcurrants, structure. It will certainly age, but drink over 10 years.",56.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Sweet, rich, dense, very much of its year. At the same time, there is the Barton touch that leaves some fine elegance, to go with the smoky fruits and richness, while acidity gives it a fine lift.",65.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Full-bodied, lush and sweet, yet despite the presence of ample botrytis, the wine retains a sense of varietal character in its lychee-scented aromas. Dried apricot and pineapple flavors linger for a long time on the mouthwatering finish. Delicious now, and should age well for at least 10 years. The 2001 and 2002 vintages are also currently available, and not far behind in quality.",210.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer

"This rounded, ripe SB makes the most of its peach and tropical fruit flavors. Green plums lend structure to this soft wine, but there's a full, crisp aftertaste. Screwcap.",12.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A rich, juicy, super-ripe wine, the fruit a powerhouse of dark flavors. In this welter of fruit, the tannin is just a sideshow, while the acidity brings a layer of freshness to the smoky character. It is still young, and needs 2–3 years.",10.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"This crisp, fruity wine is made exclusively from Chardonnay in Varnier Fannière's Côte des Blancs vineyards. It has a citrus flavor, with touches of green plum and quince, and a tight, mineral character. Ideally, this should be aged for a year, but it is drinkable now.",57.00,Champagne,Chardonnay

"This blend of 60% Syrah, 30% Mourvèdre and 10% Grenache is ripe and jammy, with intense aromas of blackberry and raspberry preserves, baking spice, chocolate and a touch of pepper.

"Hugel, a firm known for its dry-styled table wines, can make killer sweet wines as well, deftly illustrated by this example. It's full-bodied, broad in the mouth and rich, with considerable weight to its flavors of roses, dried apricots, marmalade and honey, yet stays fresh on the long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now–2020.",203.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"Just a touch less lively than the 2002 and 2005 versions, Hugel's 2001 Gewürztraminer SGN is still excellent, boasting plenty of weight and richness allied to distinctive varietal aromas of rose petals and cracked white pepper alongside the dried apricot notes of botrytis.",197.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"A crisp, delicious wine, with all the right fresh acidity, tensely green fruits and very refreshing lightness. The wine will sit delicately and satisfyingly alongside any fish dish.",11.00,Loire_Valley,Melon

"Ripe Chardonnay, barrel fermentation and aging, stirring of the lees—all these elements make for a powerfully rich wine, in which the wood acts as a carefully judged supporting act to the intense apples and cream fruitiness. There is just a touch of Burgundian minerality to give some structure.",21.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"Fitou, a small region entirely surrounded by Corbières, is very dry in the summer. In 2004, when little rain fell, the grapes became extra concentrated, as shown here. There's a powerful burst of fruit, with black cherries, coffee and plenty of spice from the 50% Syrah. Only to finish are the tannins at all apparent.",49.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"An intense wine, superconcentrated, with very rich fruit, layers of dark tannins and wood, and fruit flavors that concentrate on dark plums, black figs and ripe blackberries. The dryness and the finishing acidity show how this wine needs to age.",35.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend

"An elegant, stylish wine, with touches of toast, packed with blackberry juice, black cherries and good concentration. It's a wine with depth, richness, the berry fruits both delicious and fresh.",12.00,Southwest_France,Negrette
"Somebody was carried away with wood here. The wine is totally dominated by flavors of burnt wood— even the 50% new wood was too much in 2007. That said, the fruit could increase in weight and black berry flavors. But not just yet—in another three to four years.",24.00,Southwest_France,Malbec

"By not adding sulfur to the wine, André and Michel Drappier have managed to produce a wine with greater depth than most, perhaps compounded by the slight oxidation that gives richness. It's a food wine, dry and packed with baked apple flavor, finishing on a high note of acidity. Disgorged March 2012.",52.00,Champagne,Pinot_Noir
"This producer in the Aude  has made a rounded, rich bottling that's packed with tropical fruits and orange-zest acidity, with a lively, lemon-and-grapefruit texture on the finish. The final feel is balanced, ripe and round.",105.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend

Wood and spices add interest and richness.",13.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Red_Blend

"Intense and concentrated, with deep and full aromas and flavors of black plum, mashed blackberry and soft cassis that's laced with a hint of violet.

"Designed to go with Japanese food, this simple wine should fit well with all manner of sushi and sashimi. It has light acidity, some crisp mango flavors and a green, taut aftertaste. Screwcap.",12.00,Loire_Valley,White_Blend

"Honey and fresh orange zest aromas and flavors drive this nicely balanced fortified Muscat. There's a pleasing weightiness to it on the palate, and a slightly creamy texture to go with the pristine flavors. Try with blue cheeses or foie gras.",16.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Muscat_d'Alexandrie
"Aromas of green apples bring a fresh burst of acidity. The wine is bright, with a firm texture of lime zest and red apple skins.",12.00,Southwest_France,Colombard

"A complete wine. As it starts in the mouth, there is a feeling of everything in its place.

"Opulent yet so elegant, this wine has already achieved great balance.

"A big, burly rich wine, dominated by Syrah and by wood tannins. It is fruity, full of black plums and boysenberries, low in acidity, but structured with some good tannins. It's a wine to drink now.",17.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Smooth and opulent, this immediately appeals with its generous fruit and texture that feels like velvet. The structure sits under the seductive surface, with a chocolate wood flavor, fruit tannins and density. Age for over 10 years at least.",180.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Dominating aromas of smoky new wood follow through to the toasty flavor that covers the fruit at this stage. But, like all 2009s, this is a rich wine that will balance out and show all of its opulence. That said, it will likely always be a firm, ageworthy wine, with the dark tannins always in evidence.",90.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend

"For a Clos de Vougeot, this is at first surprisingly mineral. Only as the wine opens in the mouth do you find this beautiful ripe fruit, an explosion of red berries driven forward by black plum skin flavors and dark tannins. It is certainly powerful, but manages to wear its power lightly.",155.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"The oldest property owned by the Drouhin family has produced a wine that is initially withdrawn, showing its herbal, earthy character, before releasing an explosion of sweet berries, spice and irresistible freshness and acidity. The aftertaste is firm, and the fruit is very much in place.",89.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This is one of Louis Latour's flagship reds, a powerful wine, with its dense, solid fruits, big tannins and concentration. Those black plum juices are building up behind a firm layer of dryness. Wait until 2012 before even considering drinking.",120.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Intense and concentrated, this epitomizes the richness of 2005. The wine starts soft, with more spice than fruit, then flavors of peach and quince come through, followed by an almost tropical element. The intensity stays right through the finish of this impressive, powerful wine.",124.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This wine is all about power, from the dark and intense black fruits through to the rich, sweet tannins. It shows the concentration of 2005 in its ripeness and concentrated, delicious fruits. An impressively dense wine.",250.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir

"Full of tropical fruit flavors, this is rounded, ripe and very accessible. At the same time, its structure shows through in the tang of green apple skin, judicious wood aging and taut aftertaste.",60.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"A soft, juicy style of wine. It's made for early drinking, with light tannins, flavors of milk chocolate, red berries and only a hint of texture. There is a final rather rustic character.",12.00,Southwest_France,Malbec-Merlot
"There is a fresh, crisp character to this light rosé. It is eye-watering in its refreshing character, with balancing acidity, smoothing out the edges with a touch of caramel.",12.00,Southwest_France,Cabernet_Merlot

"Intensely perfumed, this wine shows both strength and great elegance. The raspberry flavors float over a light structure of some dry tannins.

"Richly smooth wine, perfumed, elegant, but also, because this is from 2005, packed with ripe fruit.

At the end, the acidity gives a great lift to this powerfully charming wine.",60.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir

"This full-bodied wine is packed with citrus and tight, apple-driven acidity, as well as a rich touch of apricot. This fruitiness is balanced by a deliciously refreshing character that creates texture and a steely, minerally feel.",50.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A rare rosé Champagne whose color comes from Pinot Noir skins rather than from added red wine, this has vivid colors of orange and onion skin. It is rich, tasting as much like wine as like sparkling wine, with a full and ripe, yet dry, feel.",69.00,Champagne,Pinot_Noir

"Wines from Morey-Saint-Denis should be opulent in 2005, and this wine has opulence in spades. It fills the mouth with rich red plums, red cherries and some cranberry juice to give an edge of dryness.

"Very pure fruit, packed with generous red berry and strawberry flavors, but also an almost opulent character, as the sweet fruits burst in the mouth, all over the palate. This delicious wine is showing some elegance and, on the finish, rich freshness.",50.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Mineral and initially austere, this is a reticent wine. The red berry fruits are there, but they are packed inside dry tannins. Arching over these elements is an austerity that needs time to break through. It's obviously a wine that needs aging, as it's not giving much away at the moment.",34.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"While there is crisp, green fruit here, this wine is much more about its richness, softness, roundness. There is some minerality, and the flavors of pear and citrus come through strongly on the finish.",105.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Big, burly Pinot Noir, dominated by black cherries, rich fruit and firm tannins. This is wine that shows richness, with a smoky, chewy structure and great spice and aromatic perfumes. The juiciness comes through on the finish, but never leaves the structure behind.",55.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A rich, soft, opulent style of wine that shows delicious red fruits, the tannins just as ripe as the rest of the wine. It is not all richness, because to finish, those tannins and acidity come bursting through. This wine will age.",60.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This full-bodied offering is ripe and richly balanced. A predominance of the two Pinots gives it an intense fruitiness, with raspberry and red apple notes dominating.

It's medium weight, with a direct but tasty palate and a medium-length finish. Drink now.",24.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"This late-harvest Gewürztraminer boasts hints of dried apricot on the nose to go along with scents of pineapple and spice. It's a gingery-peppery spice note that persists through the palate and onto the finish, joined by ripe pear flavors. Because it's not that sweet or concentrated, this would be a good candidate to pair with foie gras or cheese rather than a true dessert.",45.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"Not too dissimilar from an Italian Moscato d'Asti, this offers exotic scents of oranges and tropical fruit. It's a bit sweet, but balanced in part by the bubbles. This would be great at brunch, or served on its own.",21.00,Rhône_Valley,Muscat
"An impressive blend from some of the top vineyards in Sancerre, this is a rounded, smooth, almost toasty wine. It has flavors of spice as well as green and citrus fruits. Full in the mouth and intense, age this for at least two years.",100.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc

"Bel-Air is owned by the Cazes family of Château Lynch-Bages in Pauillac, and the pedigree of the winemaking shows. A rich, almost opulent wine, tempered with tannins. Flavors of dark black figs, herbs and wood come together harmoniously. It has a tense edge of tannin that promises aging.",25.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A wine that is so easy to drink, with its fresh berry fruits, light stalkiness and gentle tannins. It is fruity, juicy, bursting with bright acidity and easy flavors. Screwcap.",9.00,Southwest_France,Red_Blend

"There's a hint of caramel-like sweetness to the lush dark-fruit center of this Syrah. Dense, jammy blackberry and cherry flavors continue on the palate, with an overall round mouthfeel and a softly spiced finish. Drink up.",14.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
"Made entirely from Grenache Blanc and fortified to 16% alcohol, this is an intriguing dessert wine. After aging in barrel for three years, it's taken on some nutty overtones, yet still retains a perfumed quality and orange-citrus flavors. Probably best with cheeses or on its own.",26.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Grenache_Blanc
"A smoky, intensely herbaceous wine, with flavors of grapefruit, gooseberries and touched with juicy white pears. Just to complete the medley, the aftertaste has some spice.",9.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Sauvignon_Blanc

"This is a taut, tight, dry Champagne, needing a few more years of bottle age. It has fine acidity, with a crisp lemon flavor and a lively mousse. With further maturity, it will develop into an intense, toasty Champagne of great quality.",140.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A wine that is both fruity and almost approachable now, it is packed with the great structure of Pauillac Cabernet Sauvignon. It's rich and firmly tannic, layering plums and blackberries within a dark texture. This should be aged for at least five years.",95.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Opulent richness combines with an aromatic delicacy, with honey, orange and acacia. The freshness and acid-sweetness balance of Castelnau are already accessible.",30.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"This is pure fruit, blackberry, dark cherries and plums. The tannins give a huge burst of dryness to the wine, but at this young stage, the juicy fruit and wood are dominant.",18.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"A blend from several premier cru vineyards in Pommard, here is a wine that exhibits just the right firm but dusty tannins of the appellation. But because it is 2005, the natural exuberance of the fruit is also there, lively red berries under the dry structure. It needs some aging, but already the richness is there, along with a smoky aftertaste.",66.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir

"This rich selection has a touch of bottle age that creates a toasty character. It features ripe apricot and peach notes, with warm and taut acidity. Ready to drink.",52.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"There's a nice mélange of aromas and flavors to this wine, as hints of dried purple flowers mingle with fruity notes of brambly forest berry and black plum. Accents of leather, smoke and graphite add depth to the palate, but the finish is a bit warm.",15.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"From the Côtes de Provence, this is a lightweight sparkling rosé wine that boasts tasty strawberry and sour-apple flavors. A hint of chocolate creeps in on the finish.",25.00,France_Other,Sparkling_Blend
"The flint and sand soil of this vineyard brings out the minerally, steely character of this taut, tight wine. While it is herbaceous and flavors of pineapple and white fruit, the structure dominates. Give this impressive wine another year or two.",32.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A rich, yeasty wine, this is a ripe expression of Sauvignon Blanc, with balanced and concentrated mineral intensity and taut lemon and grapefruit flavors. There is a strong sense of structure and texture, and the wine needs to age at least two years.",70.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc

"From the cool Limoux region of Languedoc, this is almost Burgundian in its tannins and fresh acidity. Perhaps the juiciness is a little simple, but there are great wild strawberry fruit flavors.",13.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Pinot_Noir
"Almonds and a strongly yeasty element are the main characters of this sparkling wine. It's full, but the fruit still has a texture to it, leaving good acidity to finish. Good value, enjoyable wine.",10.00,France_Other,White_Blend
"The Lurtons get their fruit for this wine from the Carcassonne region, the coolest part of the Languedoc. That explains the simple freshness of the red fruits, the acidity and the supple but dry tannins. Screwcap.",9.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot
"Superripe Grenache gives this fortified dessert wine (16% alcohol) distinctly chocolaty overtones, but there's also an overripe note of prunes. Despite that, it doesn't pack the alcoholic punch or massive weight of Port, making it relatively easy to drink, with an affinity for chocolate desserts.",26.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Grenache
"The steep south-facing Chêne Marchand vineyard provides fruit for this very concentrated and impressive wine. Its weight doesn't come from richness, but rather a powerful structure that underpins a mineral tang and intense freshness.",42.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc

"Proper Nuits-St.-Georges, all dry tannins powering through the dark cherry fruit flavors, and balanced with tasty acidity. There's great potential here, the ripe fruits just showing their intensity, but for the moment, the tannins are the core.",73.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
A gentle wine with open and generous soft berry fruits showing through dusty tannins and lively acidity. This is likely to develop relatively fast into a delicious wine.,37.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Firm and hard, this shows density rather than fruit, tannin rather than freshness. It goes for the dark side of Clos Vougeot. There is some bitterness from the extraction, but the wine needs many years before it comes into balance—the juicy red fruit finish promises richness later.",240.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"The bouquet of this red blend starts off with medium-intense aromas of dried red cherry and raspberry, but transitions into secondary accents of sweet smoke and soft spice. The medium-weight palate is balanced and straightforward. Drink now.",13.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Grenache-Syrah

"Light and fresh, this is a crisp, citrusy blanc de blancs that hints at earth and ginger root. Long on the finish.",20.00,Alsace,Sparkling_Blend
"While this is packed with ripe fruit, it is balanced with a dense tannic underlay and judicious wood aging. With this structure, the wine should age for several years.",32.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Fermented in large barrels to preserve the fruit, this is a dense wine, full of the ripe red-berry and black-plum flavor that's layered with mint and new wood notes. Juicy, rich and concentrated, this is worth aging for at least five years.",60.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Very pure—this has a straight line of acidity right to the wine's citrus- and pineapple-flavored heart. It is structured and taut, with its acidity dominant. It is concentrated and ready to age for 2–3 years.",25.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Dominated by minerality, this is a flinty and steel textured wine. It has some richness while remaining straight and narrow. With its structured character, it will need to age for over several years.",36.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"This is very smoky, with flavors of bacon as well as a yeasty character. The fruit has migrated into a taut texture, spiced with parsley and bay leaf. It's mature yet still zesty.",32.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
This is a richly ripe 2009 Pouilly Fumé. It steers right to the tropical fruit end of the spectrum while not losing sight of a more textured mineral character. It is rich and could age for 1–2 years and more.,38.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Rounded and soft, this has currant and sweet apple flavors balanced with its acidity. It is concentrated and rich, and there's still some aging potential.",90.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend

"A freshly herbaceous wine, a reminder of how crisp, grassy and refreshing white Bordeaux can be. This has a lively green and white fruit character, all vibrant acidity. Drink now.",17.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"An opulent style, where the tannins are subservient to the ripeness of the red cherry flavor. The acidity enhances the sweetness of the rich fruit, and the lively, vibrant texture comes sweeping right through to finish.",33.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Pommard suits the Bouchard Aîné style. The tannins and the power, forced by the dry core, are a house signature. That said, the ripeness of 2005 also plays a part in this opulent wine. The dryness comes through more obviously, but that suggests some aging ability.",66.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A soft, ripe rosé, this is on the sweeter side of brut. It also has a flavor of bottle maturity that blends easily with attractive crisp acidity and a fragrant rose hip character. It is ready to drink.",45.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Lightly off-dry, flavored with sweet strawberries, the wine's easy flavors are just what's needed for a casual get-together.",10.00,France_Other,Red_Blend

"A lively, fresh, red-fruited wine, with a good balance between new wood flavors, spice and intense fruit. This is a great wine to drink now, with its direct fruit flavors backed with tight tannins.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A charged Burgundy, packed with dense tannins and powerful ripe black berry fruits. There's a delicious tension here between the fruits and the tannin, pushing the acidity, the red plums and strawberries forward, but keeping them in check. At this stage, it needs decanting; otherwise keep for 2–3 years.",48.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Soft and generous, full of perfumed ripe berry fruits, touched with strawberry acidity. The tannins are all part of the softness, like flecks of dust on the wine. It is beautifully pure, ripe and open.",55.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Sumptuous and creamy, this is a deliciously ripe wine. It balances fresh white fruits against almonds and a rounded structure. Perhaps the acidity is lost in all the richness, but it's a wine to relish now.",47.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Light and refreshing, with hints of berries and citrus alongside some herbal elements. The bead is a little on the large side, making the mouthfeel a bit rustic, but it'll do fine at the season's big holiday gatherings.",12.00,France_Other,Sparkling_Blend
"Hugely liquorous wine, full of honey, superripe fruit, yellow peach and apricot flavors, along with orange marmalade. This is big, very densely flavored, richly textured. It could certainly age for 5–10 years.",24.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Firmly structured, with bitter black cherries, red berry fruits and concentrated but vibrant fruit. This is delicious Pinot Noir, not powerful, but immediately enjoyable. Aging? Maybe, but not more than 3–4 years.",35.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Very fresh, very raspberry, this wine opens gently with sweetness and roundness. The tannins do come into play, but ever so gently, a counterpoint to the sweet, fine fruits that dominate this attractive, relatively early drinking wine.",40.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"From its own estate, this Louis Latour wine is a ripe, strawberry- and juicy plum-flavored wine, sustained by a well- judged dry layer of tannins. It is sweet, the acidity showing through in the red fruits.",50.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A rare misstep from Albrecht, the 2001 Gewürztraminer SGN seems a touch oxidized and nutty, with a broad, dull texture and a hint of butter on the finish. It's ripe and sweet, but it just doesn't seem quite right.",65.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"Lively and juicy, this is packed with fresh red cherry fruits, red currants and some wood. It's round, soft, only lightly tannic.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Pinot_Noir
"Typical Beaune in its round, soft character. If the tannins are not particularly powerful, it still shows a generous nature, with super-ripe fruits supported by some dryness. The finish is jammy, ripe, a salad of red berries.",41.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Sure it's a bit simple and fruity—the flavors run toward berries and citrus—but it's also cleanly made, with a slightly creamy mouthfeel and a soft, easy-drinking finish.",16.00,France_Other,Sparkling_Blend
"A pleasant surprise at such a low pricepoint, Louis Perdrier's Blanc de Blancs Brut features competent winemaking, aromas reminiscent of chalk dust and herbs and a clean, abbreviated finish.",8.00,France_Other,Sparkling_Blend
"A round style of Chablis, rich in toast and yellow fruits, this is densely concentrated, the flavors going deep into the glass. The acidity brings everything together, a crisp framework of apple juice and green berries.",40.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"In a crisp style, this has lively white fruit flavors, a youthful, steely mineral character, balanced by caramel richness and fine refreshing acidity. Age for 2–3 years.",40.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"There is a fine balance here between wood and deliciously rich fruit. It gives a ripe wine that fills the glass with spice, apricots and a crisp citrus zest. The wine glows ripely to the finish.",45.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Rich and bold, with concentrated aromas and flavors of candied cherries, raspberry preserves, ripe plum guts and accents of thyme and white pepper. Round and lush in the mouth with velvety tannins and a long, oak-infused finish. Be prepared—this is a big wine deserving of a thick steak or a hearty piece of game.",75.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Tight, taut steely in character, this tastes of its great chalk terroir. It has delicious layered crispness, green and fresh red apples, finished with a powerful citrus element. Without doubt, a wine for aging.",35.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Rustic, big-bodied, burly and propelled by firm tannins, this wine is currently closed and firm, and it takes time for the fruit to appear. The finish is more fruity, with black cherry flavors and an edge of bitterness.",42.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"From the Villamont domaine, this is a soft, rounded, quite generous wine that is dominated by enjoyable bright red fruits. It's fresh, ripe, just lightly touched by tannins, and with a juicy, friendly aftertaste.",30.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Pure Syrah, with its perfumed aromas, earthy ripe fruit flavors and dense texture, packed with tannins under the fruit. This is a great barbecue wine.",12.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
"Lulu Bernard is the daughter of winemaker Louis Bernard. Under her name, the firm has produced an open, generous, easygoing wine, more to do with the perfumes and ripe fruits of Syrah than with the structure.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
"A satisfying blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay which gives a roundness to the mineral layers of Sauvignon, while giving a lift to the Chardonnay. This is a fresh, crisp wine which would work as an aperitif, with its lift of soft fruit to finish",15.00,Southwest_France,Chardonnay-Sauvignon
"The Guibert family of Mas de Daumas Gassac calls this inexpensive line of wines “Old World” to signal their desire to make them in that style, rather than New World. This red is typically Mediterranean in its flavors: herbs, leather and ripe fruit laced by acidity ushering in a dry finish.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"There's some good, fresh citrus character here, a pleasant, light and easy style of wine, hinting at wood with vanilla flavors. Fresh acidity gives the finish a lift.",8.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"A ripe, chunky wine with smooth red fruits, light tannins and a light, fresh finish marked by acidity, but also some softness. The name “Fat Bastard” is a British expression of praise for a big wine.",12.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot
"A pleasant blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Semillon, this wine from the Grassa family in Gascony, south-west France, is in an easy-drinking style. There are soft flavors of almonds, green plums, nice light poised fruit.",11.00,Southwest_France,Semillon-Sauvignon_Blanc
"Perfumed wood dominates this wine. There is softness, some attractive food-friendly acidity and hints of red fruits, but otherwise it is spice and toast all the way.",8.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Shiraz
"This blend of Syrah and Grenache comes from vineyards owned by the Jeanjean family. It is soft and gentle, although there are some tannins hiding in the background. The fruits are clean, somewhat jammy, easy to drink.",13.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah-Grenache
"Light and frothy, this clean, palate-refreshing sparkler seems ideally suited to be an apéritif. Citrus and apple notes are gentle, underscored by some chalky minerality.",18.00,France_Other,Sparkling_Blend
"A light-bodied, somewhat austere sparkler that's short on fruit but long on mineral and earthy notes suggesting wet clay and chalk. Finishes fresh.",16.00,Alsace,Sparkling_Blend
"wine's berry and apple aromas and flavors are only modest in their intensity, but they're clean, and the steady, fine bead makes for a light, refreshing mouthfeel.",8.00,France_Other,Sparkling_Blend
"Rich Sauvignon flavors here, the herbaceous element made weighty by the full-on apricot and green plum tastes. There is a tight, steely texture, with powerful acidity well integrated with the fruit.",23.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"The aroma says wood, and that's what the taste confirms. To go with the wood, there is rounded apricot and peach-flavored fruit, open and rich. The wine has a youthful taut edge, finishing with the greatest acidity.",34.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Dark, tannic, smoky, this is solid and heavy. The fruit is there, hiding behind all the tense tannic structure, hinting at raspberries. The structure is bulky.",39.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A fresh, creamy style of Sauvignon Blanc, with tropical fruits combining with apple skins and leading to a ripe but crisp finish. A great apéritif.",6.00,Southwest_France,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A simple, fresh, juicy blend of Merlot and Grenache with soft tannins and a friendly, ripe finale. Its warmth chimes well with its name: cigales are the cicadas whose noise enlivens a Mediterranean evening.",11.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot-Grenache
"From the cool hills of Limoux in the Aude, this well-structured wine has good raspberry flavors, cherries and a layer of wood. It is firm and dry initially, but the finish mingles fruit and acidity.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Pinot_Noir
"An unwooded Chardonnay that is very soft, with a touch of sweetness and flavors of citrus and green plums.",9.00,Loire_Valley,Chardonnay
"Loire Cabernet Franc like this has great spicy flavors, rich red berry fruits and some stalkiness. The structure comes from firm, dry tannins that appear on the finish.",11.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"Fresh, crisp and fruity, this is a good light rosé that could be a fine alternative to a red wine for a turkey or ham dinner. The finish is clean, round and flavored with red berry fruits.",9.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Cinsault
"A full, ripe unoaked Chard, from the new line of French Roots wines, this has some hazelnut and green plum flavors along with light acidity. It is soft, pleasant and ready to drink.",8.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"A soft, ripe, juicy, fresh wine. There's little else, apart from the soft tannins, but it's delicious and very drinkable.",9.00,Southwest_France,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Despite some earthy, mushroomy aromas, this lightweight sparkler's flavors veer toward lemon and stones. It's rather tart on the finish, and should pair well with raw shellfish.",10.00,France_Other,Sparkling_Blend
"This is on the fullish side, lacking crispness and refreshment factor. Fortunately, the ripe apple and pear flavors are charming enough to pull it through.",13.00,France_Other,Sparkling_Blend
"No doubt this is meant to be a slightly more serious attempt at sparkling wine, but it merely succeeds in being pleasant. Obvious citrus and earth aromas add hints of ginger on the palate. It's slightly creamy in texture, finishing clean and fresh.",16.00,France_Other,Chardonnay
"A simple, clean and fresh Chardonnay, round and fruity, with some vanilla, spice and white peach fruit flavors. The aftertaste is soft, slightly sweet.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"Fruit-forward and simple, this wine's pleasant apple and citrus flavors begin to dull as the carbonation rapidly fades in the glass.",12.00,France_Other,Sparkling_Blend
"Superbly balanced with a velvety structure, this wine boasts aromas of dark black plum, roasted espresso beans and a hint of cassis. Concentrated and full in the mouth with flavors of ripe black fruit, resiny vanilla and hints of cedar and cigar box. Long and evolving on the finish, this is a superb value sure to please a crowd.",16.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Weight and richness here, with attractive acidity, but also a ripe, creamy texture. The wine has some tight tannins, but is much more to do with opulent peaches and cream.",75.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Vibrant and juicy with red cherry and blueberry playing well alongside notes of thyme and soft pepper spice. Medium weight in the mouth with soft grain tannins, solid acidity, and a finish that leaves a delicious raspberry syrup flavor lingering until the next sip. Drink now or hold for a year.",20.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A rich, creamy sparkling wine that brings out the ripe Chenin flavors: ground almonds and a touch of ginger to go with the fine maturity. The finish is bright, full of citrus acidity.",19.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"A piercingly delicious, apples and cream wine. It has the youthful freshness of Chenin Blanc, its texture rounded with a great bright acidity. Almonds are a glint in the background. Drink now, or age for 4–5 years.",16.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Densely tannic and firm, this wine has fresh acidity and red-plum-skin flavors. It is a solid, chunky wine, likely to age well, with a vibrant, juicy freshness in the aftertaste.",30.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Definitely on the dry side, showing the tannic face of Pinot Noir. This is a serious wine that reflects its status as a premier cru, a powerful mix of cranberry fruits and dark tannins, but marked by a hot, hard aftertaste.",60.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"From one of the good value communes at the northern end of the Côte de Beaune, this Chorey is soft, juicy with strawberry flavors and framed by tannins. The acidity is there, but the effect is of a ripe, easy wine, ready to drink now.",29.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"There is some good depth of flavor to this wine, the strawberry flavors going right through until they meet the tannic core. The acidity balances well, pushing the fruit through the dryness, leaving freshness and juicy fruits.",41.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This wine starts with all the crisp, clean flavors and delicious freshness of Muscadet and finishes with a very soft, light aftertaste.",9.00,Loire_Valley,Melon
"With its distinctive enameled, flowered bottle, this sets out to be a fun party wine. It succeeds with its fresh, flowery, open fruit, enhanced by vanilla, spice and green apple flavors.",7.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"This simple wine is soft and juicy, with some fresh raspberry flavors. The tannins are light, round and fruity, leading to an easy, soft finish.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot
"The tannins and the black currant flavors leave no doubt about the varietal origin of this straightforward, well-made, fresh wine.",6.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Cabernet_Sauvignon
"The most successful of the French Rabbit wines. This has some good, dense tannins, flavors of black currants and a solid, dry finish.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Cabernet_Sauvignon
"There is enticing new wood here, a wine that shows richness to boost the ripe, creamy apple and pear fruits. It has a generous character, to contrast with its core of steely acidity. The finish is more earthy, suggesting the wine still needs time in the bottle.",32.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Pure grassy Sauvignon Blanc aromas are a good start to the crisp, fresh wine. It has all the right herbaceous and green fruit flavors, very fresh, structured with green plum skins. There is a delicious final acidity.",27.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"This wine might start off a touch medicinal but that blows off rather quickly, allowing the beautiful bouquet full of red cherry and raspberry with soft touches of cocoa to shine through. Fresh and juicy in the mouth with moderate acidity and tannins providing a solid structure. A touch of citrus glimmers on the clean finish. Drink now.",28.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This is a ripe wine, structured with toast, ripe peach, spicy apricot and an attractive citrus juice character. The wine opens warmly in the mouth, but then finishes more crisply, lifted by its acidity.",30.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"There is good density of fruit tannins here, boosted by wood. The wine has dried fruit, spice, perfumed blackberry and lively acidity. It could well age for 1–2 years.",19.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"Aromas of anise and black plum flesh along with hints of eucalyptus and leather abound on the nose, while flavors of fresh-picked black berries fill out the medium-weight mouth. Well balanced with a satiny texture, moderate tannins and a long, spicy finish.",18.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"With grapes from the Limoux region, the coolest in Languedoc, this wine goes for structure, with stalky, dry tannins. Those flavors, and the black currant fruits, are offset by considerable soft finishing sweetness.",9.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Cabernet_Sauvignon
"In the medium-dry style of Vouvray Chenin Blanc, this is a fresh, clean wine with almond and honey flavors and simple, attractive acidity.",12.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"This lightly toasty, vanilla-flavored wine shows good, light, tropical flavors. It opens well, with green plums and ripe fruit.",12.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"A big, fruity wine with spicy, dry fruits, flavors of blackberries and ripe plums, and a warm, ripe feel. This is big stuff, with solid, dark tannins and a toasty wood finish. It demands big food.",12.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Shiraz
"One of the range of wines in Tetrapak launched by the Boisset group, this is firm, rather green, with herbal flavors and a dry tannic aftertaste.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot
"Full of mango and starfruit flavors to go with the nuts, spice and ripe texture. The wine, made from organic grapes, has richness as much as sweetness, the acidity an important element. For long-term aging.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"A very steely of wine, crisp, with a tight, knife-edge structure that needs more time to round out. At the moment, fresh and crisp apples dominate, with flavors of green apple skins.",34.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"An excellent wine from Côtes du Roussillon Villages, offering yummy aromas of berry preserves, milk chocolate and fresh coffee granules. The palate is just as lush and opulent as one would anticipate from the nose, with more rich black fruit flavors and a touch of mocha on the finish. Well balanced with soft, dusty tannins and a lengthy finish.",16.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A soft, rounded wine, with spice and toast and a cushion of plump yellow fruit. Almonds and mandarin oranges fit well together with the fine acidity.",45.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Beautiful aromatics of lavender, kirsch, carnation and soft plum lead into a mouth full of cherry skins, delicate sweet spice and pepper. Chewy tannins present a gripping texture on the palate, followed by a long, wild fruit-flavored finish.",23.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This is on the weighty side of Chablis, giving a wine that is more Burgundy proper in its richness. That said, there is a good citric element, but the ripeness is more important, underlined by toast.",70.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Shows some promise, offering up hints of citrus and toast on the nose, but turns simpler on the palate, where green-apple flavors dominate and the lack of bubbles results in a wine that's duller than it should be. Imported by Global E. Selections, LLC.",16.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"The famous comparison of Sauvignon Blanc to cats is certainly correct with this wine. It is flavored with gooseberries as well, a highly acid, green wine, very fresh, very crisp.",8.00,Southwest_France,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A soft, somewhat unfocused wine that offers some light herbaceous character. Pleasant when well chilled.",12.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Lean, slightly green fruit gives this wine's firm, tannic character center stage, with black currant acidity and some freshness. Light and ready to drink.",9.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot
"The wine is well made, with some attractive spicy wood. But the fruit is less exciting. A soft, smooth but anonymous style.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"A light, crisp wine with flavors of pink grapefruit and cantaloupe melons. The finish is just a touch sweet.",11.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Fresh but lightweight, this wine has pleasant green fruits and crisp acidity. There is some structure, but it seems as if  the fruit wasn't ripe enough.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Viognier
"This blanc de blancs certainly shows its dryness, but with the wonderful maturity that it is just beginning to develop, it also has plenty of richness. Almonds are emerging to balance the white, almost tropical, fruits, calming the extreme crispness of the acidity. A great wine, which should develop beautifully over the next 10–15 years.",90.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"This 12-year old shows signs of maturity, but retains freshness and liveliness as well. With its yeasty edge, toasty flavors and wonderful white fruits all in balance, it is finely balanced. The acidity is kept in check by the richness of the mature fruit. A very complete Champagne.",95.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"A top wine in the Deutz range, packed with maturing richness, balancing fresh grapefruits against toasted almonds, an elegant structure, and an impressive power of flavor, leaving a dense mouthful of wine that manages to float at the same time.",166.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"While it has very bready and yeasty aromas, you can taste the crisp fruits through this. It's an elegantly dry Champagne, with a pure line of white fruits and acidity that go with the beautiful structure. As befits the 1996 vintage, this will certainly age.",120.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A blend of Grand Cru wines from Cramant and Chouilly and Premier Cru from Cuis (which is why it is only premier cru), this is all about freshness. It's more of a soft year, so this has a lightness and crispness while giving an open character over the creamy fruit.",38.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Yes, at 12 years this is now mature, but it still has plenty of life. Ripely in balance, this is an impressive, nutty tasting wine that has acidity that acts as a foundation for the ripe structure. It shows how well pure Chardonnay in Champagne can age—and it has more years to come.",90.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"While 2000 was not a great vintage, Roederer manages to make a fine wine out of it: dry but ripe, crisp but also full-bodied, a pure line of green fruits open with a burst in the mouth. To finish, there are hints of things to come; age 5 years and more.",72.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"As they begin to mature, it's good to be reminded of the 1996 vintage. The initial austerity is now blossoming into finely balanced wines, even though the acidity is always going to be a dominant factor. This wine is still young, in fact, still with its fresh fruits, only just showing some mineral and toast character. Age for 10 years or more.",50.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This vintage blanc de blancs is very much in the relatively rich, but also elegant Deutz style. The almost tropical white fruits are balanced with vibrant, fresh acidity, and topped with a soft aftertaste that lingers with almonds and toast.",88.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"This recently released 2002 is still showing its youth, with a firm, mineral edge to it. But it does have the right refreshingly crisp character, along with intense fruits, and acidity that just powers right through. Wait 3–4 years.",64.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"The wood aging gives this wine a smooth, velvet texture, the toast lying easily over the fresh fruit that is hallmark of Renaud wines. It is finely balanced, a lively wine that has been rounded out well by the wood.",15.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"With 75% Syrah and 25% Grenache, here's a lush and decadent wine loaded with dark plum, black berry, pepper, licorice and smoky cedar notes. The finish is long and evolving, starting fruity and closing on a beautiful mocha note.",21.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Blackberry, kirsch and spice fill out the medium intense nose, while more vibrant notes of red cherry and plum abound on the palate. Lightweight with soft, dusty tannins and a solid finish kissed with oak. Drink now.",23.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Red_Blend
"As happens with Chenin wines, this has closed up, showing only marzipan flavors without the fruit. It's a stage, and the wine needs another 2–3 years before realizing its mature potential. Screwcap.",16.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Notes of olive and bay leaves add some interesting complexity to the nose of this blend, otherwise dominated by typical red berry flavors. Ripe and rich on the palate with medium acidity and lighter tannins. The finish, dominated by beautiful notes of wild strawberries, is long and satisfying.",45.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Nutty, toasty aromas open a wine that has yellow fruits, strong ripe peach flavors, some green plum acidity. The texture brings out the toast, flavored with toffee, the aftertaste full of creamy acidity.",19.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Pronounced garrigue notes dominate the nose here—rosemary, menthol and lavender—with soft notes of red fruit in the background. More cherry and raspberry show themselves in the mouth. Medium weight with a gripping structure and medium-length finish.",15.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Fat and full, this is a heavy wine, dominated by Sémillon and leaving very little impression on the taste buds.",10.00,Bordeaux,Sauvignon_Blanc-Semillon
"Fat and oily in texture, this wine tastes of tropical fruits but is too heavy and soft to give varietal pleasure.",8.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Sauvignon_Blanc
"There are raspberry fruit aromas, but the flavor is lean, with dry tannins and acidity. The finish is firm, bordering on tough.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Pinot_Noir
"Rather rustic flavors, but there is some green fruit and a hint of cream.This Tetrapak-packed wine has a full-bodied texture, with only light acidity.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"A fine vintage, which shows some age from a relatively fast-maturing year, but is now nicely poised between the initial fresh green fruits and grapefruit flavors, and the elements of toast and yeast that are developing well. This is a great food wine, with some weight and ripeness.",80.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Ripe, full, and just hinting at maturity, this remains P-J's flagship Champagne. It's poised, elegant and fresh, with signs of nuttiness. A vibrant, joyful wine, it continues to live up to its exuberant bottle.",125.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A wine that manages to straddle the twin peaks of freshness and maturity with ease. There are plenty of crisp pink and white fruits, but also a layer of mature acidity that offers a more complex series of secondary flavors, spice, toast and some tannins.",72.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"For those who like their Champagnes extra dry, this is a good example because it has some richness to balance that intense grapefruit shock on the palate. It is beginning to get some good age as well, as the structure and the toast begin to kick in. Another year, and it will be delicious.",66.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Crisp raspberries and red currants here, with a refreshing, lively acidity. If there is any intensity in this finely balanced wine, it is in the relationship between the fruit and the clean structure. But this is not for aging—drink now.",80.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This Roederer nonvintage seems to be getting drier, bringing out more of the green fruits and less creamy character. It works well here because the wine has some bottle age, giving a beautifully balanced wine that has great class and elegance.",35.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Pure apple and cream aromas, spiked with pear skin spice. As the palate opens out, it reveals tight fruit skin tannins, green plums and Granny Smith apples, finishing creamy but very fresh.",14.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Soft, juicy wine, packed with plums and red berry flavors, but given sophistication by its dry tannins. The aftertaste is back to freshness, acidity and celebration.",25.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This light, fresh wine, with its concentration on raspberry flavors, has lifted acidity and an edge of bitterness. The tannins are there, but relatively subdued, so it's likely to age quickly.",60.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"The blanc de blancs from Henriot has some fine, toasty, aged character. This is a rich, but still vibrantly fruity wine that shows some baked apple and pink grapefruit but also some maturity. A finely made wine, illustrating the benefits of some bottle age.",48.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Cuis is among the first villages on the Côte des Blancs after leaving Epernay. While it doesn't have the reputation of the Grand Cru villages further along the slope, it can produce delicious wines. This fine, lightly creamy, white currant-flavored Champagne, shows a good mineral texture, a crispness and a refreshing aftertaste.",52.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"This is a lightweight Cristal, floating and fresh, without the punch this great wine can have from Pinot Noir. It is also way too young. To taste, there is good balance, but the persistent grapefruit flavor shows the wine's youth.",211.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"As it ages in bottle, this Champagne is showing real class. It remains as delicate as when reviewed last year, but it is now showing much more mature toastiness and bread flavors, and less of the green fruits. Elegance is still the main character; a fine, pure wine.",185.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is certainly rich, packed with youthful green- and white-fruit flavors, but it still has that seductive elegance that is the hallmark of Deutz. Here is a wine that definitely needs aging. It has richness but there is still a raw edge.",67.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Fèvre's domaine Chablis is a classic of its kind—fresh, steely, with a strong mineral content to go with the bright green apple flavors. Think simply cooked fish and you'd be just right.",13.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"There's no shortage of spice in this value Minervois, with strong notes of pepper and garrigue herbs backed by notes of orange rind, red cherry and young raspberry. Medium-light in the mouth with moderate acidity and soft tannins; drink up now.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Red_Blend
"There is really ripe fruit here, a warm fruit salad and creamy series of flavors. Peaches and toast dominate, but freshened by apple. The acidity comes through but gently, leaving a sweet, soft aftertaste.",38.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Close to Sancerre, Menetou-Salon produces a soft style of Pinot Noir, the acidity tamed by fresh tannins and loganberry fruits. A hint of wood gives extra weight.",24.00,Loire_Valley,Pinot_Noir
"A warm, earthy, rustic style, richly fruity with peaches and sweet juiced fruits. There is good balance of wood, toast, nutmeg and sweet spice. The finale draws a fine line in elegance.",32.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Initially soft, with almond cream texture, this wine then comes in with some steely acidity, a tight texture, stony almost. The fruit is green apple and lychee, crisp but with some weight behind it.",10.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc-Chardonnay
"A wine that combines a light, off-dry character with crisp Chenin acids, very fresh and bright. Flavors include fine nuts, spice and sweet apples. Screwcap.",16.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Erick de Sousa chose the name Caudalies, because it is a measure of how long the taste of a wine stays in the mouth, measured in seconds. This wine certainly lasts for many caudalies in the mouth. Packed with deep ripe-fruit flavors, powerful but also elegant, this is so rich, it almost has a tropical character.",70.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Matured in 225-liter barrels (hence the name of the cuvée), this has a depth of flavor and a richness that brings out the ripeness and freshness of the fruit, and a fine, elegant balance. A delicious Champagne, that could age well.",100.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"On the dry side, showing crisp white currants, grapefruit and a chalky structured texture. A delicious wine, firmly in the refreshing apéritif Champagne camp, floating its fruit with considerable delicacy.",59.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"A finely structured, delicate, elegant wine, this has a pure white fruit and mineral character that lies easily on the palate. The aftertaste is soft but there is still a steely edge to the wine, which promises long aging. Give it at least 5 years.",72.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Yeasty, fresh-baked bread aromas, followed by an impressively fresh wine full of white fruits; white currants and pink grapefruit follow on the palate. It's well rounded with a soft aftertaste and well-balanced acidity, but there's no sign of maturity yet.",120.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"“Les Faisses,” meaning “terraces” in Occitan, refers to the vineyards overlooking the Heurault from which this wine was sourced. 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah, this is a vibrant, fruit-forward wine with ripe fruit characteristics of blueberry, raspberry and cherry along with accents of garrigue herbs and soft pepper. An easy-to-drink, ready-to-please wine at an attractive price.",14.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Delicious and inviting with notes of eucalyptus, chocolate-covered cherries and wild raspberries on the nose. The palate exhibits darker flavors by way of black cherry and plum, fleshing out the solidly structured medium weight mouth. A moderate, evolving finish closes nicely with a kiss of sweet oak.",15.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A toasty, smoky wine, with freshening acidity, crisp green and white fruits and an attractive edge of toasty oak. The wine is lively, fresh, delicious, very poised and vibrant.",25.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is without question a food Champagne. Toasty on the nose and powerful and full bodied on the palate, it is rich with sweet strawberries and just a touch of toast.",120.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A young wine, with crisp apple and grapefruit salad freshness. It is bright, glowing with vibrant fruit and a light touch of toast.",18.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A lovely blend from the Languedoc comprised of 60% Cabernet Franc, 30% Syrah and 10% Merlot. The nose and mouth offers loads of menthol and garrigue herbs (especially lavender) along side bright small red berries and sweet green pepper. Medium weight and well structured with a lengthy finish.",14.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Red_Blend
"Starts off a touch funky, but that subsides after a couple of minutes in the glass. Black plum and cassis are strong on the nose and mouth, backed by accents of vanilla, black pepper spice and roasted coffee granules. The finish is long and evolving, moving from black fruit flavors to cherry pits and ending on sweet oak flavors.",15.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Red_Blend
"A soft wine, holding its freshest fruit back. At this stage, it is creamy and rich, hinting at yellow fruits, but still very reticent. Some sulphur remains on the palate but should blow away in the next few months.",18.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A nice straw/pale yellow color, the nose on this wine is subdued, with hints of grain, lime and slate, but the palate perks up with plenty of citrus flavor leaning toward lime. Balanced, with a smooth feel and tiny bubbles, this delicious sparkler will instigate caviar dreams.",18.00,Burgundy,Sparkling_Blend
"This has certainly benefited from some bottle age, bringing out the nutty, lightly toasty character of older Chardonnay, while still preserving great white fruit flavors.",50.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"A full-bodied, rounded, well matured bottle, with plenty of attractive toasty flavors rather than fruit. This is a delicious bottle-aged Champagne in an old style, that will be great with food.",40.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A rich wine, creamy, with nut and toast flavors following fresher, crisper aromas. It is softening and coming well into its own, but still keeping a fine structure, along with ripe apple tastes. This should certainly develop further.",120.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A deliciously dry wine, evoking flavors of crisp green-apple skins and white currants; this is elegant despite its weight and body. It has freshness, certainly, and needs some bottle age. The style is ripe, but the dryness gives some opening austerity.",54.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Bright and concentrated at the same time, with strong notes of black berries and cassis backed by softer notes of yellow flowers, almond skin, rosemary and pepper. The mouth is lightweight but full, with soft acids and a short but clean finish. Very approachable; drink now.",19.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Very perfumed wine, just on the right side of green. The tobacco and dried fruit flavors cut through with intense acidity, breaking out of the dry tannic core.",15.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"Ripe and soft, this revels in its jammy Pinot Noir character. The dry tannins creep in later, supporting open red fruit flavors topped with black plum skins. The finish is all strawberry jam.",33.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"An unusual Nuits-St.-Georges. Normally the wines are dark, dry and tannic. But this is fruity, light, fresh. With its vibrant red fruits, it seems very out of character, if pleasing.",44.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"The palest of pinks announces the lightness of touch that makes this wine so attractive. Sure, it has ripe strawberry flavors, but they are delicate, laced with acidity, good freshness. A real apéritif wine.",75.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A ripe, rounded wine, with just some wood. It is soft, with flavors of apricots followed by a fresh acidity and a final waft of tropical fruits and spice.",25.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Currants and white fruits layer with acidity and a tight structure of crisp apples skins. This is a full-in-the-mouth wine, showing plenty of acidity, but also a rich fruit character, hinting at the honeyed sweetness that is not far away.",13.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Bitter black cherries are the hallmark of this rather hard-edged wine. It shows dark tannins and fruit that misses full richness. Maybe it is restrained power, maybe it will age, but the balance is not there now.",36.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A full, balanced wine with layers of grapefruit and a pure citrus streak. Secondary flavors of almonds and toast add complexity. This is not profound, but it is eminently enjoyable.",50.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Light and fruity with cherry, plum and red currant flavors along with a subtle hint of menthol on the nose. The mouthfeel is smooth and supple. Mevushal.",13.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot
"Not very intense, the sharp citrus and chalky pencil shaving aromas are followed by minimal fruit flavors of barely ripe apple and stone fruit skin.",23.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"Lacking intensity, the nose exhibits mild notes of ripe red apple while the palate adds a touch of canteloupe. Fat and round with a fleeting finish, the wine never really makes a strong impression.",13.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"One of Faiveley's monopoles (wholly owned vineyards), Clos des Cortons makes powerful wines. That's the case in 2005. This wine towers up, a strong edifice of tannins and big, black fruits. It has all the right elements coming into place, along with weight and some elegance.",195.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A big, burly wine, powerful, concentrated and packed with fruit, the tannins a potential aging advantage underneath all this delicious fruit. Solid, but charming at the same time.",190.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A beautiful rounded wine, full of juicy fruit, but sustained by a strong tannic structure. This dryness suggests good aging potential, as does the ripeness of the fruit and the acidity. Keep for at least 6 years.",95.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Not many sparklers have anise aromas to match white stone fruits, but this 100% Chenin Blanc has just that, and more. Crisp and lively with citrus fruits flavors, especially lemon and lime, the wine has firm mineral and some stemmy notes to add character.  Goes to show you can still find good French sparklers for bargain prices.",12.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"A new blend of this best-selling Champagne is soft, creamy and openly fruity. There is acidity, but it is kept in place by the intensity of sweet fruit, which trails off to a soft, gentle finish.",35.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This wine is dense and tough, the fruit submerged under the tannins. It has great fresh acidity though which shows that the fruit just needs the time to balance out. But it is certainly young; give it 6–7 years at least.",90.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A round, full-bodied wine that goes for the generous, opulent fruity aspect of red Burgundy with its big, blowsy red fruits, just kept in check by tannins. The acidity is lively and fresh, keeping pace with the intense vibrant fruits. Screwcap.",169.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"An impressive wine, fueled by black plum juice flavors. The acidity is just right, balancing the richness of the fruit. The wine revels in the serious side of Echezeaux, packed with dark, tight tannins over the fruit. It needs at least five years, maybe 10.",115.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Big, juicy fruit, bolstered by tannins, gives this wine weight and impressive structure. There is a dry core surrounded by ripe plums, herbs and fresh spices , resulting in soft, juicy freshness. But those tannins promise aging potential.",125.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A salmon-infused slate color, this wine starts off gently with a nice yeast aroma. Citrus flavors interact with light boysenberry, again with a soft overlay of yeast. Crisp, with nice body and good bubbles, this is balanced and delicious.",15.00,France_Other,Sparkling_Blend
"If Nuits-Saint-Georges has a gentler side when young (as a contrast to the normal firm tannins), this wine shows it. The tannins are certainly here, but the ripe fruit shines through more than balances that dryness. Fresh strawberries and red plums round this off.",90.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Although this is dominated at this young stage by wood, you can get through the firm, spicy character to the dark, heady fruit flavors. It has concealed power and intensity of ripe, elegant fruit. It needs at least 10 years to mature.",102.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Initially earthy aromas give way to red fruits. The wine follows the same pattern, the barnyard flavors opening out with the ripe red plum and strawberry fruits. There is a delicious richness here, balanced with acidity and firm tannins.",95.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Attractive aromas of wood and red fruits introduce acidity and red berry flavors and soft tannins. Fruity, ready to drink.",18.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A hint of sulfur blows off to reveal muted cookie and chalk, but the palate opens up with lemon-lime flavors and a smokey edge. Crisp and steely in the mouth, it hints at roundness and sweetness without taking the plunge.",20.00,Rhône_Valley,Clairette
"This wine shows a richer, smoother mouthfeel than others of its ilk. The nose is nicely toasty, with tropical fruit aromas and mint. Flavors are similar, dealing out nicely oaked fruit that goes down easily.",16.00,Burgundy,Sparkling_Blend
"Salmon-colored, with nice scents of strawberry and leafy red berry, this sparkler has big, zesty bubbles and flavors of lime and citrus touched with red berry. Crisp on the finish, with citrusy-apple flavors.",15.00,France_Other,Sparkling_Blend
"A bit overdone, with aromas of leather and prune and flavors of molasses. Still, it's not as heavy as it sounds, and it finishes with some chalky tannins, so it does have some structure. Try with beef stew.",12.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Smells really nice, with bubbly Grenache fruit making a strong statement on the nose, but falls off a bit on the palate. Ripe and pleasant, bursting with black cherry fruit, just lacking concentration and length.",8.00,Rhône_Valley,Red_Blend
"Fresh and crisp, this is a wine which has fine acidity. It has an earthy, barnyard element which gives it weight and fatness.",13.00,Rhône_Valley,Marsanne
"Light and crisp, but pleasant, with cherry and black pepper flavors on a lean frame.",11.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Nice clean nose, with scents of cherries and white pepper. But what are the green, stemmy flavors doing on the palate? Modest cherry fruit, but this medium-bodied wine finishes herbal and astringent.",15.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"The wine is named after a raspberry plantation, and that's what it tastes like. Small wild fruit, with their extra taste of ripe flesh, are in the glass along with delicious acidity. The tannins and the wood are all at the service of the fruit.",33.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Rich and dense, revealing ripe fruit, touches of wood and firm flavors, and a delicious juicy interior which bursts through. It revels in this fruit, all red berries and fresh acidity. To finish, there is some toasty wood.",79.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This is deliciously hedonistic in the best traditions of Volnay, opulent and powered with flavors of blackberry jelly, dry tannins and perfumed violets. This is a big, ripe, solid wine whose perfumes give an enticing exotic aftertaste.",55.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A 100% Sémillon wine, this crémant has a rich yellow color, aroma of crème brûlée, vanilla and charred oak, and plenty of toast on the palate. Behind the oak veneer are lemon-lime flavors powered by zesty acidity.",20.00,Bordeaux,Sémillon
"A little pretentious with the appellation (it could be Pouilly-Fumï¿½), but nothing but great wine in the bottle. Aromas of grapefruit, apple, mustard and wet stones are framed by gentle notes of cinnamon and toast. The palate is louder as it sizzles with razor-crisp orange, apple, peach and grapefruit, all with a proper mineral, herbal edge. Rock solid, but cheerful and universally likable. Imported by Beaune Imports.",60.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"This is a rich, rounded wine with pure red berry aromas. The initially soft tannins has a dryness that creeps up as the fruit increases in its richness. Layers of wood spice support the fruit rather than dominating.",50.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"An intensely aromatic wine with dense, concentrated black plum and herbal flavors. This is somber and dark with dry tannins as well as perfumed raspberry flavors.",34.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Faiveley makes the most of the powerful tannins associated with Nuits-Saint-Georges. The dryness is blackberry tannins; the wood is kept in check. Full, concentrated, a powerful wine, needing aging.",59.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A pleasant, fresh wine, with flavors of strawberries and a crisp, poised and elegant aftertaste.",60.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Big and bold, with powerful aromas of apple, lemon curd, melon and toast. Features the ripest fruit going, and that results in tropical-influenced flavors of pineapple and pink grapefruit. Playing second fiddle is a cinnamon-spice undercurrent with a hint of banana. Imported by Beaune Imports.",80.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"This dryly tannic wine shows some red berry fruits, but the initial taste is tart, and this doesn't completely disappear, leaving a hard edge.",14.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"From Bouchard's home vineyard, this is one of their signature wines. In 2005, it has produced a luscious, fruity wine whose richness is only a part of its wonderful floating character. The ripeness of the wine is matched by its structure, which promises considerable aging.",42.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A bright yellow wine with fine bubbles and a full mouthfeel. A touch of yeast enhances crisp citrus aromas, while the flavors are lemon-lime followed by the extended citrus family. Good acidity keeps it racy.",8.00,France_Other,Sparkling_Blend
"A bit sweet and melony on the bouquet, but still pretty and substantial. Super fresh on the palate, with tangerine and grapefruit on one side and peach and nectarine on the other. Finishes chalky, with drying citrus and a smack of green herbs. Imported by Robert Kacher Imports.",27.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Offers a lot of what makes Sauvignon a good pairing partner. The nose is minerally and bright, with nectarine, melon and light smoke aromas. Not overwhelming in terms of flavor, as grapefruit and lemon carry the palate. Finishes lean, even and crisp. A perfect wine for oysters. Imported by Maisons Marques & Domaines USA.",48.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Full and fresh. Lots of mineral along with almond, white peach and citrus on the nose. Zesty enough, with roundness as well. Flavors of melon, apple, peach and more mix well together. Shows a bit of heat late, which folds into pithy bitterness at the very end. Imported by Kermit Lynch.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Immensely flowery, with pure honeysuckle and touches of melon on the summer-fresh nose. Rather full and big on the palate, with intense flavors of green melon, peach and spice. Only medium zest to the finish, but sneakily powerful. Imported by Rosenthal Wine Merchants.",23.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"This has plenty of very ripe red fruits, but at the same time the tannins push through, firm and dry, and, at this young stage, tough. It promises some good aging, with the wood element coming into balance.",23.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"As befits young Pommard, this is still firm, and leaves plenty of room for development of its smoky black fruit Pinot Noir flavors. But the promise is here, with the intensity of dry tannins and structured fruit ready to power through in three or four years.",65.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Take a whiff and you'll get a combination of sweet and spicy fruit done up with notes of sandalwood and incense. The palate is mostly raspberry with a hint of chocolate, and although the feel is fairly lean, tangy and edgy, there's enough smoothness and girth here to register some positive points. Best Buy.",8.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Plum and smoke aromas with pure cherry and strawberry flavors. Always the steady value wine, and this one has force and power that makes you take notice. The tannins are a bit large, however, causing some drying on the finish.",9.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot
"At first, the aromas are lean and mildly pickly, with just some cranberry popping through. On the palate, it's quite the same scenario: the first flavors are of green peppers and tangy berries. With time, however, things come together and those green, sour notes slip to the rear and are replaced by riper cherry, spice and modest tannins.",16.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A Grenache, Syrah, Mourvèdre blend that has good points, like its hickory nose, tight structure and decent country fruit but also some weak notes like saucy flavors, heavy tannins and a grapy, grippy feel. It's the type of wine that you want to be very good but which isn't quite up to it.",20.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Red_Blend
"With a fading, rather light color, it's hard to believe that this is only a few years old. In the nose, there's a slight burnt character, one of matchsticks and red pepper flakes. The palate, like the color, seems mature; it's soft and round, with a mix of oak and berry fruit. This wine is fine, if a little weak, but the real fault is that it has no signature feature. It's decent but just there.",9.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Fruity, slightly gummy aromas signal black raspberry, plum and cherry. Indeed, there's plenty of berry fruit on the palate, that and some pepper. The finish is lively and tasty, with hints of coffee and mocha toward the very end.",7.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
"The bouquet is hard, tight and full of tobacco and green beans. Right away you get the impression that maybe the fruit for this wine wasn't quite at its ripest. How else to explain the strong green character at the core and the lack of sweetness? That said, the feel across the palate is good, as is the color and tannins.",16.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Passion fruit, white pepper and mildly overripe pear and apple aromas lead into a juicy, lively palate defined by flavors of orange and pepper. The acids are good, so the wine feels and tastes fresh. And while you wouldn't call it a sophisticated drink, it has zip and ample varietal character.",8.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Spicy, with raspberry and spearmint aromas. Shows cranberry and plum skin on the palate, which is lean and lacking in the texture category. Gets better with airing, but still shows some bitterness on the finish and not much in the middle.",8.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,White_Blend
"Tart and grassy, with definition to the nose. Gentle lime, grass, stone fruits and apple flavors make for a perfectly fresh and tasty palate, while the finish is dry, crisp, borderline tart and racy. Very good for everyday, no-frills Loire Sauvignon. Imported by Frederick Wildman and Sons, Ltd.",20.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Veers into the mineral, spiced-apple realm before displaying citrus in the form of grapefruit, melon and peach. Quite minerally and dry, with a citrus and melon influence to the finish. Mainstream and healthy; perfect restaurant Sancerre. Imported by Kermit Lynch.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"The wine is dominated by its dry tannins, which ride over the less exuberant fruit. Toast shows through, giving spice. Only on the finish is the juicy fruit given a chance. Like many Faiveley wines, this needs time—6 to 7 years at least.",40.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Talcum powder, orange peel and a bit of fresh-cut grass make for a pleasant bouquet. Quite forward and fully charged on the palate; there's melon, apple and lemon as well as some softer peach flavors. Good and lively. Imported by Vineyard Brands.",26.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Fresh and crisp, with pure mineral, lemon and orange-blossom aromas. Delicate on the palate, with subtle citrus andpineapple flavors. Extra stony and complex on the finish, and while it's a bit buttoned up it registers as exceedingly friendly. Imported by Baron Francois Collection.",25.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Just enough chalk and mineral is present on the bouquet to complement the melon, citrus and green herb notes. Very much of a streamlined, tight wine on the palate, where melon, lemon and citrus pith come together. Refreshing, dry and firm; the perfect shellfish accompaniment. Imported by Louis Latour.",30.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Lively, full, tangy and precise. Our tasting panel was unanimous in its support for this minerally, citrusy wine; we very much liked its fresh green apple, grapefruit and white peach flavors, and we're sure it would be an excellent food wine, especially with fish. Imported by Frederick Wildman and Sons, Ltd.",26.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Undoubtedly the real deal in terms of size. The nose is rich, oily and pungent, but it's hard to extract any true fruit aromas from it. The mouthfeel is similarly full, with melon, vanilla and citrus. Essences of peach, orange pith and white pepper work well on the finish. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",48.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Exotic and encouraging, with as much mineral and stone-like aromas as there are grapefruit, green melon, herb and mustard seed scents. Citrus is definitely the lead soldier on the palate, which is tart and crisp. Tangerine and other citrus fruits carry the zesty finish to a pointed termination. Imported by David Milligan Selections.",25.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Quite meaty and spicy, with mustard and cured-meat aromatics. This wine is a quick starter but a slow finisher. The banana and pear flavors charm at first but slip away quickly and without much noise. Nonetheless, it's rich and mouthfilling enough to satisfy.",22.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Viognier
"Starts with dandelion and lemon-lime aromas that don't meet any preconceived notions about Sauvignon Blanc. The palate is basic, with orange and tangerine flavors, while the lean finish is dry, zesty and warming.",12.00,Southwest_France,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Spicy, with raspberry and spearmint aromas. Shows cranberry and plum skin on the palate, which is lean and lacking in the texture category. Gets better with airing, but still shows some bitterness on the finish and not much in the middle.",8.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Red_Blend
"A touch oaky, with burnt sugar, mint and lemon aromas. It is firm and tannic, with proper acids; the peppy palate has good blackberry and cherry fruit, and the finish is ripe. Starts fast but loses some of its appeal as the tannins mount.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot
"A ripe, perfumed, relatively soft wine, which is going to give great pleasure with its juicy fruit, ripe jelly flavors and balancing acidity. You could enjoy this wine within a year, but it should age well over the next five or six.",20.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Exotic fruits dominate this rich, ripe wine. To taste, there is an array of lychees, mangoes, nectarines, all giving richness and almost sweetness to the palate. It's already ready to drink, and should mature quickly.",54.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"Made from the vineyards of Grippat and de Vallouit, which Guigal recently bought, this is a firm, surprisingly closed wine at this stage, with a bright mineral character, new wood and rich fruit. It needs three or four more years to open out and develop.",26.00,Rhône_Valley,Marsanne
"An attractive, red-fruited, jammy wine, named after one of the top vineyard sites in Saint-Joseph. It is full of ripe, bright tones, attractive acidity and strawberry fruits. This is a wine that is already drinkable, but will improve over the next five years or so.",25.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Surprisingly, considering the importance of Guigal in the region, this is the first time the producer has made a Crozes-Hermitage. But they have certainly started with a fine bang, with this finely perfumed wine, bringing together ripe fruit, acidity and sweet, jelly flavors. There are even tannins to give it structure and concentration.",15.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"A finely soft wine, with concentrated ripe fruit that just demands to be drunk now. Red fruits, sweet jelly flavors and soft tannins come together into an enticing blend.",15.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"A blend of 60% Syrah, 35% Grenache and 5% Mourvèdre gives a jammy, structured wine with dusty, perfumed, warm tannins and welcoming ripe fruits. Like all negociant Côtes du Rhônes, this is ready to drink now, but could age over the next five years.",10.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Perhaps the most classically styled of these Chablis from Moreau is the Vaucopin, which features zesty lemon and lime aromas allied to crisp pear and green apple flavors. Finishes tangy, with hints of anise and toast. Try with oysters or soft chèvres.",28.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Named after owner Philippe Desmeure's son, this has a new wood dominated wine, but also with dusty tannins and ripe, black fruit flavors. It was aged in small 225-liter barriques and this has given the wine a polished, ripe perfume of spices and new wood.",30.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Dark and tough, this shows considerable wood at this early stage. Like many Faiveley wines, it is tough and tannic when young, with a dry core. But I also taste red fruits, fresh acidity and a lively, fresh aftertaste. Just be patient.",25.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"While it retains plenty of freshness, this shows layers of wood, richness, spice flavors and some smooth tannins. Black cherries, juicy fruits and toast come together on a rounded finish. Despite its obscure appellation, this wine is more than just a curiosity.",20.00,Loire_Valley,Gamay
"For a Nuits wine, this is soft, with juicy fruits and a rustic texture. It's rich, with layers of acidity over the red cherry fruits. Perhaps the epitome of Pinot.",95.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A blend of fruit from the northern Rhône and Languedoc creates a deliciously spicy, fragrant Viognier with plenty of apricot and orange flavors touched with vanilla. Rich, rounded and finely balanced.",13.00,France_Other,Viognier
"A rich yellow color, this wine shows prominent oak flavors and aromas. Toasty vanilla dominates the nose while butter and toast wrap around Chardonnay's flavors of yellow fruits. A bigger style, with big bubbles and a round feel.",15.00,Burgundy,Sparkling_Blend
"This wine has a nice whiff of yeast along with crisp red fruit. Persistent bubbles and Pinot-like flavors of ripe strawberry, cherry and cola coat the mouth. On the sweet side of dry, and eminently drinkable.",9.00,France_Other,Sparkling_Blend
"Ripe apple and peach aromas are numbed by a heavy mineral note. Generic but very pleasant flavors of citrus, melon and white pepper do the trick. Stony and crisp, and clear as polished glass on the finish. Just not terribly complex, however. Imported by Weygandt-Metzler.",21.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Early aromas of clove and spice give way to chunky berry fruit and some grassy notes. The palate bursts forward with juicy fruit and full tannins, and the finish is reasonably long. Snappy and simple, with a forward attitude.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Cabernet_Sauvignon
"Quite gold in color, with vanilla, candle wax, banana and apricot aromas. All this may make it sound more complex than it is; in reality, it's a basic wine with apple and citrus flavors and a somewhat flat, low-acid feel.",9.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Viognier
"An odd mix of butterscotch, grapefruit and celery aromas doesn't prepare you for the sweet and chewy palate that's loaded with apple-like fruit and plenty of citrus and melon. Lacks refinement but is generous with the sugary fruit.",14.00,Southwest_France,White_Blend
"The nose is a bit smoky, with nuances of pepper and pine needles. A shock of oak forges through the center of the palate, and it wrestles with the light, fading berry flavors. The body and feel seem right, but there's a lack of purity and power that holds it back.",9.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot
"The funky nose kicks up leather, iodine and malted chocolate prior to a lean, muscular palate of condensed plum and berry. Pretty tannic stuff, with lots of grab across the cheeks.",11.00,Provence,Red_Blend
"Aromas of maple, black pepper and cherry cough drop get it going in a fair to midland direction. The palate is basic, with only some standard berry fruit and oak, while the finish is lengthy and easy, but also kind of mute. In terms of mouthfeel, some hard tannins prevent it from falling into the “friendly” category.",18.00,Bordeaux,Red_Blend
"Sweet and musky smelling, which in its own way is appealing. The palate is a mix of grapefruit, melon and other citrus, and lively acids keep it kicking while your tongue does a double take. Good, but a bit too tangy and jumpy.",9.00,Provence,Rosé
"Quite nondescript, with spicy chili aromas and other hard-to-peg piquant smells. The palate is sweet, awkward and deals cinnamon and clove along with weak berry fruit. It's almost there, but throughout it lacks a certain something.",8.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot
"Delicious fresh Pinot Noir, this is a full of strawberries, smoky wood and juicy tannins. It is not a wine for aging, but makes the most of sheer pleasurable drinkability.",24.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A simple yet quaffable bubbly, this has a heady perfume of ripe cherry with red berry and citrus flavors. Runs on the plump side, with lower-than-average acidity.",9.00,France_Other,Sparkling_Blend
"Fat and pumped up, with raw berry fruit that's rough and ready. Black plum and cherry flavors seem to pick up some mint character, and there's coffee on the finish. There's also some fierce, grippy tannins that grab and don't let go. And for that, it takes a large step backward. A kosher offering.",13.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
"Maybe once this was “special,” but now it's fading. The color is rusty and the tannins have gone fishing—meaning they waved goodbye a while ago. Interestingly, dried cherry and nutmeg flavors along with some leftover barrel notes make it worth a try.",13.00,Provence,Red_Blend
"Pepper, mint and plum aromas, followed by heavy cherry and pepper flavors on the palate. And it's here that green pepper sneaks into the picture. And it's here to stay, as evidenced on the finish, which is leafy and green. —",9.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot
Applesauce and stone-fruit aromas are better than the sour flavor profile that is defined by grapefruit and tangerine. Scouring but cleansing.,13.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"Lots of oak on the nose, and for that matter, throughout. The wine tastes of lemon, vanilla and wood resin, while the creamy finish deals even more oak. Texture and richness are not a problem, but the wood runs roughshod over the mild, base-level fruit.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"Brawny up front, with bacon and berry aromas but also some awkward grassiness. The palate is covered by red plum and strawberry, while the finish is easygoing at first, with crushed berry flavors, before turning bitter, raw and unrefined.",7.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Cabernet_Sauvignon
"Forward and lively, with jammy berry aromas. Quite lean and zippy in the mouth, with tangy huckleberry and cranberry flavors. Lacks nuance and character but goes fast and furious on the red fruit. Probably too tart for its own good.",25.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Yellow in color, with heavy popcorn oak and aromas of burnt almonds. The flavors are of melon rind and buttered toast, and while the finish isn't exactly cloying, it's definitely thick and grabbing. Seemingly 1998 is just too old for a white wine with a pedestrian pedigree.",10.00,Rhône_Valley,Marsanne
"Herbal, foresty aromas are followed by a palate that delivers strawberry fruit and some light oak. Not a prime-time wine due to a biting lean finish and thin mouthfeel. Lots of red fruit throughout, but also drying tannins.",13.00,Rhône_Valley,Red_Blend
"The floral and lavender notes make the nose pretty, and the bright purple color indicates that it's young and ready. On the palate, big cherry and plum fruit is amplified by very high acidity. And the finish is tart and piercing.",7.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot
"Toasted English muffin greets the nose, while the palate embraces ripe, almost tropical white fruit flavors. There's acidity but it's low, making this seem more like a still wine with bubbles than a Mousseux.",10.00,France_Other,Sparkling_Blend
"Green pepper and tobacco aromas signal some of the sour fruit that appears on the palate. Tastes of beets and pie cherries and an oaky, disparate finish doesn't do much to shape things up. Too sour and scattered.",23.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Cherry, plum and earth aromas lead into a tart, lean palate that struggles to offer more than a modicum of cherry and cassis flavors. The finish is sweet and spicy, which makes for an odd, not terribly appealing combination.",8.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Cabernet_Sauvignon
"Michel Laroche has been branching out of Chablis in recent years and his southern French effort has some chlorine notes along with aromas of mint and sweet wood. The power is up there, but there isn't suppleness to match. The palate pulsates while the finish is dark and sharp, with a burnt flavor.",7.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot
"Berry aromas come in front of a tart pie cherry and rhubarb palate. The feel is tight and acidic, so it lacks for mouthfeel and cries out for food. As a bistro or supermarket buy it offers the most potential.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot
"Rubbery and spicy in the nose, with a hint of orange peel. In the mouth, a heavy flatness sets in fast. The wine seems old, and for a rosé, it is. It just sits on your palate, tasting o.k. but needing a poke in the ribs.",13.00,Provence,Rosé
"Sweet, light and floral, but not fruity. Lemon and orange flavors yield to a zesty finish. Simple and very high in acidity.",8.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"Light and oaky at first, with earth notes. But then it goes awkward, showing imbalanced berry and plum fruit and overt oak. The wine shows some complexity and style, but at the same time it's all over the place, with hard tannins that subtract from the final tally.",13.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Red_Blend
"This blend of Syrah and Grenache has minty, wet-plaster aromas, but also some pure Grenache notes. The palate runs tart, with cranberry and cherry. And the finish is tight and bitter, with more acids than tannin. A viable bistro wine but go no further.",9.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Red_Blend
"Sweet aromas of leather and caramel seem murky and tired. The palate comes without snap, and that's despite some plum and raspberry flavors. The finish is lean and basic, and overall it's a simple wine that doesn't really taste much like Syrah.",8.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
"Almost tan in color, with neutral aromas and a dull, almondy flavor profile. Round and smooth. but all in all it's boring and fading fast.",10.00,Provence,Rosé
Melon and peach aromas start out fine but lose clarity. Citrus flavors that aren't quite full precede mild lemon and banana on the tail end. Nondescript and turns hot at the end. Kosher.,14.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"Light in color, in fact almost transparent. The nose is full of tomato, brier and dried herbs. In a word: it's weak. The palate is equally lean and spicy, while the finish seems starched out and on its final legs. On the plus side is a leathery feel and some dried-herb nuances that mingle below the surface.",29.00,Rhône_Valley,Grenache
"Big but murky; there just isn't much focus to this leathery, full-fruit bruiser that seems to draw its energy from a powerful beam of acidity that runs through the center of things. Short on balance and charm, but big on extract and tannins.",9.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Cabernet_Sauvignon
"Peppery and green in the nose, with black olive aromas and little ripe fruit. That green quality carries onto the palate, where things are thin and vegetal, with just a hint of sour raspberry to keep it afloat.",15.00,Rhône_Valley,Marsanne
"Spicy, peppery aromas yield to tomato but not much fruit. The palate is sour, with tart plum and cherry. And the finish is equally lean and tart. High acids and not much fruit equals a lower-end wine.",7.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Cabernet_Sauvignon
"The Sauvion family's flagship Muscadet is richer than some, with fresh apple flavors as well as the more characteristic grapefruit. This is lively, lightly prickly on the tongue, deliciously crisp but with some weight and intensity.",16.00,Loire_Valley,Melon
"On the earthy, rustic side of Pinot Noir, this shows firm tannins and fresh fruit. The structure is dry and taut, the berry flavors floating over this tense base. Then some ripeness shows, with perfumed and smoky bacon flavors. Age for 4–5 years.",40.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A light colored, Pinot Noir-dominated wine, with soft tannins, flavors of red plum skins and soft, ripe, strawberry jam. It has a round structure although it definitely tastes cool climate with light flavors and texture.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Red_Blend
"This is a full style of Vouvray, rich, complex, with almonds and concentrated fruit flavors. The balance and elegance are exemplary, ripe but freshened with red apples, pears and a touch of tannic structure. It shows what a few years age can do for Chenin Blanc wines.",15.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"A deliciously crisp, Gamay-based rosé that sings with crisp, acid fruit, flavors of currants and fresh raspberries. The finish is crisp, with white peach tastes.",18.00,Loire_Valley,Gamay
"Attractive spicy, soft Shiraz from southern France. It has sweet red jelly flavors, fresh acidity and an open, generous character of fresh pepper and dark plum skins.",12.00,France_Other,Shiraz
"Solid tannins mask some sweetness in the highly perfumed fruit, flavored with spices, tobacco, dried fruits. This has some good depth, allied with rich touches of wood.",17.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"A soft, luscious style, very easy, full of red fruits. The tannins do offer a core of tension, but then smooth vanilla and toast come through, leaving a fresh, rounded, raspberry-flavored wine.",13.00,France_Other,Pinot_Noir
"Attractive white peach perfumes and crisp, creamy acidity give this wine great freshness as well as a red apple texture. There are some tannins from crisp fruit, and an attractive prickle of acidity.",12.00,Loire_Valley,Melon
"This comes from high up in the Chevalier-Montrachet vineyard, from vines surrounding a small workers shed, the “cabotte.” It is the better of the two bottlings from this vineyard by Bouchard, although “better” here is like differentiating between two stars on top form. It has great poise, so although the richness is there, it is shot through with acidity and citric flavors that underline the huge, ripe fruit. Age for 10 years for best results.",500.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"As Anne-Claude Leflaive describes it, this wine is all about the complexity of the vineyard's soil. There is minerality and finesse from the chalk, which gives a structure. And at the same time the ripe fruit seems opulent, with vanilla and spice flavors adding something exotic. Age this wine for at least 5 years.",175.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A fine wine that offers power, generosity and also a chalky, mineral character. No wonder Montrachet is seen as the greatest grand cru—it has structure, concentration, delicious fruit and layers of complexity. It also needs to age. To drink this wine now would be more than a shame.",500.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is a beautifully shaped wine that rises from a quiet opening. Muted and slightly closed up at this stage, it opens opulently but with balanced acidity and crispness, as well as richness and restrained power.",596.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A wine of promise, but still in its infancy. This grand cru, structured and still waiting to open to its full opulence, is packed with concentrated flavors. It's a powerhouse that needs at least five years to even begin to show its structure, ripe fruit and richness.",228.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This wine is deceptive. At first smell and taste, it doesn't show much—its spice and green-fruit aromas are not at all obvious. It's when you roll it around your mouth, that all the layers of flavor emerge. It is powerful, rounded, but with a fine line of minerality that holds the whole wine on a knife edge. The wood is beautifully judged, the fruit just beginning to develop secondary aromas. Hold for several years.",600.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"The richness of this wine envelops you from the start. It is all about opulence, but it's balanced with layers of ripe fruit and wood. At this stage in its long life, this wine from a fine white wine vintage is still dominated by fruit. The secondary flavors will start to show in 3–4 years time. A powerful wine that does not lose sight of a potential partnership with food.",320.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A rich, round style, full, with white fruit flavors along with a central herbal streak. It has weight and some deliciously herbaceous fruits, structured to finish.",29.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Very green, with a hint of toast, this estate Muscadet has plenty of definition. It is rich, full-bodied, with flavors of ripe pears, pink grapefruit and lemon thyme. The acidity is certainly there, but is almost a background to the many other flavors.",10.00,Loire_Valley,Melon
"A deliciously fragrant wine, with full-bodied, round peaches and melon combining with crisp green plums in a fruit salad of flavors.",10.00,France_Other,Chardonnay-Sauvignon
"It's not so much the fruit but the richness and concentration that mark this wine. Yet it's not superripe because of the hot 2003 vintage. This wine, with its origins in biodynamically grown grapes, preserves a great purity of fruit as it layers intense almond and citrus flavors over vanilla and yellow fruit tastes. It should age well.",113.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Mineral and structured, this is a wine that is very linear and almost austere. There is elegance, fruit and wood along with a hint of ripe plums and peaches. But always that minerality, that steely character, which promise long aging.",253.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is the one grand cru that is entirely in Chassagne-Montrachet. It's a tiny patch of land (4.13 acres) making wines that are more delicate than the others. With its fine, fresh flavors so light to the taste, this is a wine that floats on the palate with a smooth, silky texture. Wood and white peaches contribute but do not dominate.",250.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"The most well known of Puligny's premier cru vineyards, Les Combettes is at the very heart of the slope. This central position shows in this dense and concentrated wine that's big, powerful and marked by fresh fruit-salad flavors of green figs, green apple and spice. The whole is borne up by a fine, solid structure of wood and tannins.",119.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is the smallest of the grand crus of Puligny-Montrachet, a mere 8.6 acres. This wine shows the vineyard's typical elegance, with delicious flavors of pears,  almonds and vanilla, hovering on the palate for minutes, leaving a dancing freshness.",250.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"The pinnacle of the white wines from Roux Père et Fils, this is  properly opulent, gorgeously rich, spicy and full of quince and lychee flavors, along with a discrete layer of new wood. Its complexity pays due respect to the quality of the vineyard. Keep for many years.",109.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Rich and ample, this is an impressive wine. The fruit and wood flavors work together to give a feeling of seriousness and great ageability. With its spice, toast notes and dark-hued structure, this will age well over the next five to 10 years.",280.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Relatively closed up at this stage, not giving much, this wine is all about freshness, poised but rich fruit and a structure that suggests long-term development. The wood is quite prominent, overshadowing what will be delicious yellow-fruit flavors. Come back to this wine in five years—it will be magnificent.",102.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Bâtard-Montrachet is the largest of the white grand crus, yielding archetypal fat, open, generous white Burgundies. Louis Jadot's wine does not disappoint. It's a powerfully ripe, opulent wine that's generous and packed with delicious fruit balanced with a judicious touch of wood.",203.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Relatively tight and closed up at this stage, this wine is all about freshness, poised but rich fruit and a structure that suggests long-term development. The wood is quite prominent, overshadowing what will be delicious yellow-fruit flavors. Come back to this wine in 5 years time—it will be magnificent.",110.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A big boy with almost fleshy fruit. The flavors push into exotic, tropical richness yet retain spicy citrus-rind highlights. There is nothing clumsy, despite the ripeness; the finish seems to extend almost infinitely and keeps zinging you with surprises—marshmallow, marzipan, cookie dough, etc. An added bonus: the back label clearly indicates when it was bottled and cellared (2001).",36.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"While the wood aromas dominate, on the palate, there is a much richer, rounder character. This wine, with its huge fruit, white peach flavors, layers of wood and citrus, is just waiting to burst out of its youth. Delicious ripeness and acidity lend balance, while the oak needs some time to calm down and mature.",198.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"An intense, complex wine that flows unctuously with rich white fruits, spice, vanilla, some toast and a great depth of flavor. At this stage, the toast is quite dominant, but the rich fruit is on its way up. Like many great white Burgundies, this wine needs to be opened well in advance of drinking.",61.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Like many wines from Lafon, this is initially deceptive. It bursts open in the mouth, like a fruit bomb. But watch for the structure as well, because this is a wine that will age. Keep for at least 5 years.",156.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Blending grapes from two vineyards—Les Case-Têtes (broken heads, so called from the steepness of the slope) and Les Murgers de Monthelie—Patrick Javillier has created a big, bold, ripe wine that keeps a mineral, crisp center. The toast from 11 months in wood is beginning to calm down, and this will age magnificently.",78.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Full, but structured, this is a wine that shows a serious side to Meursault. It layers fine stone-fruit flavors with crisp apple skins and some fresh toast and butter. It should improve over 5 years.",68.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This delicious, crisp wine reveals the more delicate side of Chardonnay. Coming from one of the high vineyards in La Grande Montagne of Chassagne, it has pure, elegant freshness, supplemented by a touch of vanilla.",85.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Impressively fine bubbles cascade up from the bottom of the glass, suggesting richness and elegance. There's a lush creaminess in the mouth, packed with flavors of candied orange, apricot and pineapple. The wine scores a flavor bulls eye in every possible way, from the textured, enticing bouquet to the rich, mouth-filling fruit and on through the lingering, precise and powerful finish.",39.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Densely structured and classically perfumed, this simple appellation wine shows the quality of 2005 Pinot. The red plums and currants are poised within a framework of dry tannins and fresh acidity, and a smoky aftertaste. Age at least five years.",22.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Offers very soft fruit, open and rounded. There is some acidity, some flavor of melon and pears complemented with toast and an edge of citrus. The finish is lightly mineral.",12.00,France_Other,Chardonnay
"Full, rounded wine, with herbs, some green tobacco and spice flavors. This is fresh, but full, well balanced and with a creamy apple aftertaste.",14.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Soft, open wine, very much in character with the appellation. It does lack some depth, and is more surface freshness and fruitiness. That means it is not for long aging, but is certainly fresh and delicious now.",36.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Made from 60-year-old vines, evidenced by its concentration and serious ageability. It is structured, firm and relatively dry at this young stage. It's a wine that needs at least 5 years. Today, if you do open a bottle, watch for the mineral, stony character that pushes the fruit and demands attention.",85.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A grand bottle of pink Champagne, round and luscious. The flavors come on like a cherry cordial, with exceptional Pinot Noir character and finesse. It is a seductive, elegant and textured wine that shows a level of detail and length that only the finest examples achieve. Subtle but very rewarding.",76.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A cuvée of 100% grands crus vineyards. Massive, effusive bubbles explode in the glass, and the nose rises up with rich toast and brioche. Far more weight and concentration than the excellent “La Francaise.”  Prélude wows you with fresh pastry, marzipan and lemon meringue set against grapefruity acids. Young, luscious and built to last.",70.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"The reputation of Les Combettes for charm is borne out by this deliciously ripe wine. It has layers of fresh fruit flavors, a touch of spice from the wood, and a long aftertaste. And, for the future, the acidity and the underlying structure promise at least 5 years of evolution.",110.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"You can almost taste the stones that give this vineyard its name. This is a mineral, firm, tight wine that demands time to develop. The fruit is there, with flavors of white currants, but wait for this wine—at least four years.",72.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is what you expect a prestige Champagne to look, smell and taste like. Poised and stylish, it layers sharp citrus fruit with spicy wood and light toast. Layers of citrus, tangerine and flower blossoms unfold elegantly; lime and grapefruit accents add interest, and above all it comports itself with impeccable balance, precision and grace.",49.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A crisp, steely, minerally wine that's packed with fruit that is poised to come out over the next few years. It is firm, taut and on a tight rein at this stage. Oak gives a spicy element. Keep for at least three years.",95.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"An intense, well-balanced wine with deliciously ripe yet lively green-fruit flavors. The wood is integrated, providing a cushioning richness to what is already a delicious wine. Girardin owns 3.7 acres in Les Folatières.",83.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"The complexities of Burgundy! This is the vineyard next to the more familiar Les Charmes, just up the slope—hence dessus, meaning above. This vineyard gives a mineral character, hinting at Chablis, but with some Meursault richness as well. Hold this wine, with its delicious vanilla flavors, and it will be ready in a year.",69.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Full-bodied, big-hearted, ripe and joyful, this is a welcoming, enticing wine. Flavors of green plums, nutmeg and fresh citrus are part of the pleasure. But so are the open, generous, almost opulent flavors.",89.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"It's not a bad name for this vineyard—Charmes. This wine, which expresses the nature of the vineyard, is certainly approachable, friendly almost. But there's also a steel fist there that demands time. And if you can't wait, it's a great wine to drink now.",92.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"New-wood aromas, plenty of spice and yellow fruits, but also a beautifully-shaped wine. It's complex yet generous, ripe yet elegant. For village Meursault, this is excellent.",37.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Pierre Morey also runs a small negociant business, Morey Blanc, specializing in whites from Meursault. This is one of the wines, a delicious, fresh, crisp wine that's packed with light, airy flavors of green apples and citrus.",120.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"There are at least four vineyards in Meursault called Charmes. Wines called Les Charmes can use fruit from both Les Charmes Dessus (above) and Les Charmes Dessous (below). This wine from René Monnier shows round, luscious fruit flavors balanced with some spicy toast and richness. The wine is ready to drink.",70.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Coming from the largest of the Puligny premier crus, this is a big, bold, ripe wine.  Still structured at this young stage, but generous and packed with green plum and lime flavors. The wood gives tannins but doesn't dominate.",70.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"In the fat, buttery style of white Burgundy, this wine, with its malolactic flavors and its vanilla flavors, would appeal immediately to California Chardonnay lovers. Except that it also has elegance: a hint of steel and a touch of acidity to temper the tropical fruits.",70.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"From the Bouchard domaine, this wine is soft and ripe. There is some structure and firm acidity, but that's secondary to the luscious flavors that roll around the mouth. The wood broadens but also gives extra complexity to the wine.",84.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is a really good rendition of this extra-tart, austere style of Champagne. Citrus and steel are the prime components—don't look for tropical fruits, toast or buttered nuts in this baby. This is a terroir-driven wine; it tastes like the chalk it's grown in. Can you say oysters and caviar? How about triple crème cheeses, foie gras, etc.? Made for the richest food you care to throw at it.",60.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Chenevottes is situated high up on the Chassagne-Montrachet slope, above the grand cru vineyards. With its fat, ripe butter and coconut milk character, this wine offers an immediately appealing style. But there is a hint of ageability in its layers of serious wood and structure.",49.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Rich and spiced with wood flavors, this is a rounded, powerful wine. The flavors suggest kiwis and pears leading to vanilla and caramel. It is developing well and is ready to drink.",56.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Still tasting young, and not yet showing all its power, this is still an impressive wine. It is firm and structured, with citrus and mineral flavors dominating the concentrated fruit. The wood shows through via a warm spiciness. This will certainly age for 5 years or more.",103.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This shows the more racy, fresh side of Meursault. It's a wine that dances and jumps around the mouth. Light but still full of delicious green fruits. The wood is there, but it's such a delicate touch.",84.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is a classy package, and the wine lives up to it, showing extra dimensions of power and weight. The flavors are layered and unfold gracefully; apple to citrus to pineapple. Then it slides into stone, chalk and fennel, moving finally to a nicely etched, crystalline clarity as it slowly fades across the palate.",60.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A lively, almost racy wine that has delicious ripe fruit, lovely fresh acidity, lemon and green-apple flavors and an appealing layer of new wood. Chardonnay lovers, this is for you.",70.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is styled in a relatively mature, slightly oxidized fashion. It's round and full-bodied, with lots of oily, buttered-nut flavors. But it is not at all tired or tiring; an underpinning of crisp apple keeps it lively and fresh in the mouth. It drinks very well right now, as if it had been cellared for four or five years.",120.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Big, intense and ripe, this wine has great flavors of ripe apples, almonds and honey from the malolactic fermentation. It is poised, elegant and powerful—a balance that is the best of many worlds. From the Roux domaine, it is finely crafted and likely to age for many years.",75.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Perhaps the best-known of the Chassagne-Montrachet premier crus, Morgeot is a wine that delights the taste buds. Moreau's example has enticing flowery aromas, ripe red apple and fresh almond flavors, and a friendly, open character that is tempered with some fresh acidity.",70.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Like so many Drouhin wines, this is beautifully balanced. The wood, green fruit, spice and acidity already in fine harmony. There is a richness coming from the deep soils of the vineyard. Can it age? Probably, because of the firm structure.",65.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"With its sandstone soil, the Abbaye de Morgeot vineyard is equally suited to Pinot Noir as to Chardonnay. But it is able to produce fresh, fruity wines, like this one. A spice and citric blend dances on the palate.",64.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Producing some of the more refined wines of Meursault, Charmes also has the right amount of opulence. Louis Latour's wine brings out all the richness and ripeness; soft, generous and full-bodied and leavened with spicy wood flavors.",75.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Perrières is often described as the greatest of the premier crus of Meursault. Wines like this certainly need aging, with their structure overlying the typical opulence of Meursault. It's possible to enjoy this now, but it would be worth waiting 3–4 years at least.",90.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Leflaive owns a small parcel of vines in the Clos Saint-Marc and also buys grapes from neighbors. The wine is ripe, but still has restraint, with flavors of green plums and a touch of spice. A firm structure promises aging, and there's a delicious fresh zing to the finish.",56.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"More steely than some Meursault, this layers wood and mineral flavors with a fine structure and tastes of apple skins and nutmeg. This wine could age 3–4 years, but it is already delicious.",45.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"From its origins in the fifth century, Châteaumeillant has produced wines on the edge of the Massif Central. This crisp, unoaked red is a simple, red cherry, fresh Gamay, with lively acidity and a touch of earthiness.",18.00,Loire_Valley,Gamay
"Elegance is the hallmark of this wine, which flows round the mouth with generous flavors but still leaves a fresh, crisp aftertaste. Green apples, spice and wood all balance well.",89.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is a full-flavored, round and spicy ready-to-go bottle of bubbly. The LeRoy Neiman graphics and cava-style bottle suggest party time, and the flavors are right up against banana-ish tropicality. But the ripeness is nicely cut with leesy acids, and the wine manages not to fall off a cliff; rather it extends itself with layers of stone and mineral.",35.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A very pretty copper color, just faintly tinged with pink. It's a sensuous, spicy wine with forward, pretty aromas of strawberry, raspberry and sweet cherry. It doesn't fade in the mouth; there is real concentration here all the way through. It actually seems to build intensity as it sails into the long, graceful finish.",40.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Blagny is a small hamlet just up the hill from Les Perrières. This is a cooler spot, and the wine shows this with its structure and flavors of fresh green fruits over generous portions of wood. A wine that should age for more than 5 years.",48.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"From the domaine of Pierre Morey, who is also cellarmaster at Domaine Leflaive. Like at Leflaive, he works his vines biodynamically. This is a layered wine; the pure, crisp fruit partnering with light toast flavors and a poised and structured apple-skin aftertaste.",80.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Pale straw in color with a fine bead. As always, this is an elegant, distinctive and impeccably crisp Champagne. It is the epitome of stylish; tightly focused, it gently unwraps itself into a graceful, immaculately clean finish that's lightly toasty and hints at coconut and vanilla wafer.",35.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Though very ripe, the wine's richness is somewhat hidden by a blast of SO2 until you have given it some good aeration. Then the true nose emerges, and if you like fresh-baked pastries and a creamy style of Champagne, this is your bottle. The fruit is peachy/tropical, and an unusual spice note—wintergreen?—adds some lift through the long finish.",110.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This excellent producer makes a lovely, copper-colored rosé, which sends up fresh and inviting aromas that suggest fresh-baked apple pastries. Baking spices, cinnamon in particular, liven up the scents and flavors, and the wine seems crisp, balanced and full in the mouth. It's a complete, nicely evolved wine, which seems to be at the peak of flavor.",60.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Very fine bubbles, with a firm, precise entry that is stylish to the hilt. This is a confident, assertive style, tart but not thin, with fennel and lemon-oil streaks running through the green fruit. It holds together nicely on the mid-palate, like a rock in the midst of a freshwater mountain stream. Young and crisp, it sails into a long and complex finish that promises rewards with a bit of further cellaring.",44.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"I applaud the fact that Paillard clearly labels his wines with the date of disgorgement—this one was August 2005. The wine immediately offers up enticing scents of peaches, apricots and cherries. It's a full, fruit-powered Champagne that's round and rich and unusually ripe. It delivers a lot of flavor up front, and holds there through a clean finish.",56.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Ripe, open and packed with melon and tropical fruit flavors, this wine is already showing enticing drinkability. Its fresh, ripe fruits is layered with some mineral character and an under-cushion of wood.",65.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A firmly tannic, structured wine, with some fresh strawberry  and high acidity. There is a cushion of velvet as the tannins soften in the mouth. Give this at least 2 years.",20.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A blend of Pinot Noir with César, an ancient variety of the region west of Chablis. This gives a slightly foxy character to the wine, the tannins smoky and tight. It is definitely firm, with red berries and good amounts of acidity.",30.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Citrus and white peach aromas promise a tropical SB. And that's what the palate offers, with rich peach and apricot flavors, with plenty of fresh acidity, almonds and ripe fruit.",10.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"For a village wine, this is impressive. The richness and ripeness of the grapes translates into a full wine with white- fruit and spice flavors. But quite properly, there is a fine, poised mineral streak from the chalk soil that gives the wine shape and balance.",80.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Rich, buttery and forward, but with a fine streak of minerality to give structure and interest. The wood gives a spicy character to the wine, but it doesn't dominate the rich burst of fruit.",57.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Duval-Leroy has its finger on the consumer hot button; this is what most people conjure up in their mental palate when the word Champagne pops up. Full, almost fleshy, and richly delicious, this is not the most complex or elegant bottle. But in terms of delivering big, friendly flavor at a fair price, this is the one to beat. I particularly like the way the wine continues to evolve on the back palate; it doesn't just sit there and grin at you. It smoothly rides into a toasty sunset, waving its big hat.",30.00,Champagne,Sparkling_Blend
"A Meursault-based domaine that has progressed rapidly in quality under Philippe Ballot. This Genevrières is a rich, young wine that promises an open, ripe, wood-layered series of flavors in 2 years.",79.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A full, rounded wine with yellow fruit and citrus flavors lying over vanilla and toast flavors. This rich wine is ready to drink despite a good touch of minerality to finish.",85.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Sweet, full-fruit flavors and elegance mark this friendly wine. The wood flavors blend effortlessly with the citrus and kiwi fruit, leaving a fresh, lifted aftertaste. The 2004 marks a good return to form after the less successful 2003s from this domaine.",50.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Round and generous, but with a mineral heart that gives structure to this full wine. It has weight, dense fruit and delicious peach and nectarine flavors. The structure suggests this Morgeot has the potential to age.",59.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"What a delicious, drinkable wine with peach and fresh-fruit flavors, a touch of pineapple and a touch of almonds. Relish the wine now, or enjoy over the next 5 years.",70.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Fragrant and deeply colored, I like the intensity of the flavors, which include dried herb, orange peel, citrus and pear. It's an interesting, somewhat offbeat wine—a more complex, more rustic and evolved style.",76.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Faiveley's general firm style of red wine is a great advantage in this simple Burgundy. This wine has structure, red berry acidity, ripe tannins and a lively, vivid flavor. To finish, there is plenty of ripe acidity.",20.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A nutty, mineral driven wine, with flavors of pears and limes coming through a dry acid layer which gives considerable freshness. This is light, elegant, very crisp and dry to finish.",12.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Powerful, intense wood aromas dominate this wine initially. But on the palate, there are also fruit flavors that push at the wood, giving delicious apricot,  white fruits and some honey to go along with the vanilla tastes.",42.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Beautiful  green-plum flavored fruit shows how good Saint-Aubin can be. The vanilla flavors from wood fermentation and aging simply underline the pure, vivid flavors. Drink in three to 10 years.",42.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is a great Meursault that's full of round, ripe, generous fruit. It's packed with yellow fruit and kiwi flavors. Revel in its richness. This wine comes from Bouchard's own vines.",36.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Gosset's reserve bottling is always a rich, textured wine packed with an appealing flavor parade of fruits, toast, nuts and vanilla. Ripe and doughy, it's not what you would call subtle or particularly elegant. But if it's big, ripe flavors you want, with plenty of fruit, here you go.",60.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"High up on the slope, the Sous le Puits vineyard has produced a ripe, open, buttery wine that is full of generous, opulent fruit. It is packed with pineapple, tropical fruit and lime flavors, along with a hint of caramel and almonds. Ready to drink now.",49.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Very rich, ripe and packed with new-wood flavors, this is somewhat flashy, but it's still delicious to drink. Sit back and enjoy.",69.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is baseline Deutz, but still a standout. Sniff it and you sense the complexity, definition and elegance. Good, tiny bubbles stream up steadily, bringing notes of chalk, candied fruit and caramel. In the mouth, it fills out across the palate with mixed flavors that show stone fruits, caramel and oily, slightly buttery nuts. Very approachable yet complex, refined and aristocratic.",51.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This starts out on the right foot, hitting you with a whiff of toasted nuts and crème caramel. The maturity of the blend seems well calculated; there's a very nice mix of crisp green fruit, spicy clove, and more mature, slightly oxidized, nutty flavors. This is not a big wine, but it fills the palate evenly and persists with a core of pleasing, lightly salty, somewhat oily roasted almond.",39.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This comes from the negociant side of Pierre Morey's business. It is full, rich, fat, open and quite opulent. Yes, the acidity and the freshness of the fruit are there, but this is a generous wine that will develop relatively quickly over 2 to 3 years.",84.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A coconut streak stands out immediately, then there's a vertical wall of stone, citrus and licorice. I like the intensity and the definitive spices that layer this wine; it's not shy or pedestrian. The style may or may not suit you, but it's well worth exploring. It finishes up crisp, with a green, citrusy lift.",28.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is a dense structured wine with some herbal flavors as well as kiwi and green plums. Fruit dominates, leaving the wood with a walk-on part. It is developing slowly and needs another 2–3 years to open fully.",62.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A spicy, nutty wine that shows some of the Meursault broadness but also offers some subtlety, with ripe fruits layered with more complex wood and herb flavors. This could age well over the next 2–3 years.",40.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Spicy fruits vie with blackberry flavors in this soft, rounded wine. The tannic element comes through in some stalky edges, but the finish is ripe and soft.",10.00,France_Other,Cabernet_Sauvignon_Grenache
"A ripe, juicy wine, layering red plums, rhubarb and some spice. There is a warmth here, which goes well with the soft tannins. The finish is fresh and soft.",10.00,France_Other,Shiraz-Merlot
"On the rich side for a Muscadet, with an earthy character, sage and lemongrass flavors touched with gala apple creaminess. This certainly has a riper side than many a Muscadet.",12.00,Loire_Valley,Melon
"Firmly dry, with mineral austerity from the core of classic Bordeaux tannins. The acidity, the black currant fruits and the flavor of licorice and bitter chocolate are all there.",12.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A big, fat wine that lives up to the popular image of Meursault. Perhaps it could do with a little more depth of flavor, but it's a ripe glassful of Chardonnay now.",80.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is a lively, fresh wine with good acidity, a touch of toast under the fruit and a great burst of energy and zing in the aftertaste.",53.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Mumm makes a mighty fine mid-priced bottle, with plenty of toasty flavor to lift it into an orbit close to where the big boys fly. The fruit is on the lighter side, but crisply defined, and it segues into the round, satisfying flavors of older, more mature Champagne. The bubbles are gentle and petite, and the flavors linger elegantly all around the tongue.",43.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A fine bead in the glass, it shows a bit more warm, round fruit than in previous bottlings, leading into a slightly bitter finish of citrus rind, lime zest and wet stone.",37.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"The typical fat, buttery flavors are balanced here by elegance and freshness. With its honey, melon and pear tastes, come fresh acidity and a underlying layer of vanilla from the wood.",39.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Ripe, rich and round up front; then this moves into some interesting, concentrated flavors of spicy, lightly candied fruits. There is also a definite mineral lift to it. The acids are strong but not abrasive, and the wine carries a stony freshness through the finish. It does not evolve, but it persists and cleanses the palate while inviting another sip.",54.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A blend of grapes from Languedoc and Bordeaux, this wine has a good balance of richness and structure. Watch for the spice, the herbal character and the soft tannins. There is a green element, and the finish is full of black currant juice flavors.",13.00,France_Other,Cabernet_Sauvignon
"Haut-Poitou, to the south of the Loire Valley, specializes in fresh, crisp Sauvignon Blanc like this herbal, grassy wine, dominated by grapefruit, green berries and some sage. There's a cool structure to it, leaving freshness.",10.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Bouncing rosé, with raspberry flavors and some fresh acidity. The finish is sweet, like a kid's fruit-flavored candy.",10.00,France_Other,Grenache-Syrah
"Aromas of toast dominate this wine, but the palate is better balanced with citrus and apple flavors. But it does need time for the wood to calm and to integrate. Don't confuse this Machard de Gramont with the one owned by Bertrand Machard de Gramont—this is Burgundy.",47.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"The latest edition of the Excéllence is the best in years. The crisp young flavors—like a tart green apple—are focused and unusually intense. The acids are lively and nuanced with lime, and the wine avoids the beery, yeasty excesses of previous bottlings. Dry, fresh and clean, it's a cava-style Champagne; it seems made for fried seafoods.",43.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Rich and accessible, this is a rounded, buttery wine with fine, sweet acidity and delicious open fruit. It just demands to be enjoyed.",46.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A soft, open wine with some vanilla flavors emphasizing the opulence of Meursault. The wine is ready to drink now.",65.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A firm, quite mineral style of wine, perhaps austere at this stage. With the lurking wood flavors, this promises to open out in 2 years, giving a concentrated, compact wine.",52.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
This wine shows crisp citric fruit allied to layers of spicy wood. Then it opens with some ripe white fruits and thirst-quenching acidity. It should age well over 3–4 years. The Abbaye de Morgeot vineyard is in the southern part of the appellation.,60.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Steely and minerally, but also has fresh white and yellow fruit flavors. Bright acidity finishes this highly drinkable wine.",50.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A village Meursault, but one which has been treated like a cru, with layers of ripe wood balancing  the pure green- and white-fruit flavors. This is ready to drink now as it is well balanced and deliciously fresh.",68.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Round, white pear flavors, with some tannic texture, this is a simple, fresh, crisp Sancerre, favoring pink grapefruit and sage, and touched by a lightly sweet edge.",29.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Soft, very light and fresh, with flavors of wild strawberries. Good acidity, with sweetness coming through to dominate the pleasant freshness.",13.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"Very light, this is full of fresh raspberry with a sharp acidity. Ready to drink.",18.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A raspberry-flavored wine, light and easy. The tannins are stalky, suggesting red currant stalks, and the acidity fresh, with a citrus touch. May be too lean at the end.",17.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Very crisp, grapefruit and green herbs, here is a wine that touches good acidity, but then misses with its oily texture and white candy flavor. The finish is fresh.",14.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A wood-dominated wine, with spice and toast. The citrus and white fruit element is very much subdued. The aftertaste continues on the same theme—dry tannins from the wood. Give it a few months and the balance should be better.",48.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"The color alone sets this wine apart from its peers; it's what can only be called Barbie doll pink. Fresh and foamy, it spurts out of the bottle as if to say “Par-tay!” Fruity and flavorful, it carries hints of rose petals, citrus zest and cherry Lifesavers.",40.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is an enjoyable wine, open and soft, with crisp white and yellow fruits, a touch of citrus and a touch of wood to give it all shape. Drink now.",54.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A fruit-driven wine that balances a flinty character with flavors of green plums. It is fresh, light, poised, crisp and green.",49.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Although this comes from a vineyard outside the Meursault appellation, the vines are tended with the same care as any Meursault vineyard. The wine is rich, with flavors of almonds and lemon. Rounded out with a light application of wood.",21.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A lively, rich, very fresh and crisp wine that has some of the buttery character of Meursault. This is open, easy and generous.",43.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Juicy white currants and soft almond flavors go into this medium-dry wine. It has some softness and richness, but there is also a firm edge of structure and minerality to it. The aftertaste hints at sulfur.",16.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Bright, fresh Muscadet, brimming with simple apple and citrus fruit flavors. There's a touch of almond, clean herbal flavors and some tongue prickling lightness.",10.00,Loire_Valley,Melon
"This is a medium-sweet, pleasing almond and white-fruit flavored wine that, with its low alcohol, makes a good drink by itself. It's a clean, fresh wine, has some good depth of finishing acidity and ripe fruits.",11.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Strawberry/salmon pink, this party-ready wine comes on light as a feather. Almost frothy, it's delicate, like whipped butter; its richness is suggested rather than felt. All the pieces are in balance, but very light, and perhaps in a tasting with bigger, more powerful wines it seems insubstantial. But it's quite well made, creamy, spicy and refreshing.",60.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Round, ripe and lemony, it's more like a very good California sparkler than fine Champagne. Tasty, fruity and approachable, but missing the refinement and the texture that elevates the very top Champagnes.",50.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Bold, vivacious and forward, this appealing wine is true to the house style, with plenty of sweet, pretty fruit. There are unchallenging but undeniably enjoyable flavors of ripe stone fruits, hints of grapefruit and citrus zest, and a smack of wet stone in the back of the throat. Young and fresh, without the toasty finesse of the vintage rosés.",50.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Soft and open, this wine has the generosity and drinkability of a good village Meursault. There are flavors of quince,  spice, a touch of citrus and some vanilla.",49.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A lively, fresh and relatively light wine, showing the soft and easy side of Charmes. It is ready to drink but without the opulence of some wines from this vineyard.",80.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Joseph Belland is based in neighboring Santenay, where the estate produces red wines. But this wine, from right next door in Chassagne, is a fine, ripe wine with some vanilla aromas and a rich texture balanced by some easy acidity.",82.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This soft wine shows  fresh, easy acidity and pineapple flavors. The wine opens fully in the mouth; it's like a sunburst of fruit and citrus, with just a touch of wood.",46.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Roux Père et Fils, based in Saint-Aubin, has done much to enhance the reputation of the appellation. This wine shows the potential of the ripe fruit that can be produced in a year such as 2004. Perhaps the winemaker was carried away by new wood, but that should tone down in a year.",28.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This wine hasn't quite settled down yet. There is still some rusticity to it, which at the moment detracts from what is obviously rich fruit. Give it a year.",72.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A hard-edged Chenin Blanc, lean, quite austere with almonds and green herbs dominating the fruit. Freshness is missing here, giving way much more to structure.",10.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"On the nose there are medicinal aromas alongside some sweet candy. The palate is a mix of red berry candies and firm tannins, and caramel from wood. The wine is given shape by tannins and has a juicy red fruit aftertaste.",28.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A fresh, light, crisp wine with some good mineral overtones layered with toast. While it doesn't have great complexity, this is an attractive, citrusy wine that's ready to drink now.",67.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Open, ripe and generous, this sums up what is so enjoyable about Meursault, with-out losing sight of a more serious, structured side. But drink now; it's ready.",30.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Disgorged in May 2005, this is still not quite knit together, but the components are flavorful and appealing. There is plenty of ripe fruit hovering between citrus and tropical. And there is toast and perhaps a hint of butter, which softens the back end and lengthens the finish. But it doesn't completely hang together; it lurches a bit, like a car needing transmission work.",43.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This wine is soft and ripe, but seems to lack structure. Don't expect it to age.",79.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A good, fresh, green wine with attractive, ripe fruit. This is an easy, drinkable Chardonnay, that comes from the southern half of Burgundy.",15.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This village wine is full of ripe, open tropical fruits and an attractive caramel touch. The whole is wrapped in clean acidity and a delicious lift to the finish.",50.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Full and fat, this wine has pleasant white-fruit flavors. It is fresh, but rather unfocused, with toast coming through the fruit to dominate the aftertaste.",63.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Quite foamy and shaded toward very pale salmon/copper, this young wine tastes of green apples, spice, wild strawberry and cherry candy. It's pretty, clean and light, but thins out a bit quickly.",47.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is the first vintage of a wine produced from a 22-acre estate bought by Anne-Claude Leflaive of Domaine Leflaive in Puligny-Montrachet. This is packed with deliciously fresh apples and cream flavors, yet it's very intense and crisp. The ripeness of the fruit is balanced by an elegant aftertaste.",29.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A sweetened wine which has some apple and cream flavors, with a hint of honeyed texture. But the balance is not right, with acidity and sweetness clashing around the fruit. The aftertaste continues this battle.",15.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Big and powerful, this is the grandest of the grand crus. It has both  a dense structure and overwhelming fruits. With minerality, spice and balance, this is a very complete wine. There is only a hint of the richness to come. Hold for 10 years at least.",95.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is the epitome of great Chablis, with minerality, initial austerity and coiled power. It is a dense, tense wine, structured with both toasty tannins and green fruits that shine out of all this concentration. Age for 7–10 years.",85.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"There is much concentration and freshness here, along with much power and intense minerality. The wine is very rich with butter, ripe fruit and layers of considerable acidity. Wait 6 years at least.",76.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Often seen as the easiest of the grand crus because of its richness, this shows more power due to the vintage. There is some tightness to the ripe structure, with white currant, pear skin and spice flavors. Finishes with sweet acidity.",85.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Using the old name for Bougros, this is from the steepest portion of the Bougros vineyard. The pure chalk soil gives it pronounced minerality, and it shows firm structure, with green apples, toast and a very firm, tight character. This wine definitely needs to age; give it 5–8 years.",86.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This flagship wine is Laroche's selection from the best wines of Les Blanchots. At this stage, it is young, its aromas mineral and crisp, but its future generous richness is very evident. It will be an intensely powerful expression of Chardonnay, touched by wood, and leaving great concentration. Screwcap.",100.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Initially this is closed up, then the wood and the superbly rich fruit assert themselves, unfolding into toast, lime, tropical fruits, plums and a dense, fresh acidity. It is still coming together, working up to being a superb wine. Give it 10 years.",97.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Touched by wood, this wine is more about the huge, rich fruit flavors; the yellow peaches and mangoes are balanced with a defined citrus element. Rich, but given structure from the crisp grapefruit flesh and red apples.",65.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A very warm, generous, ripe wine, this comes from the most precocious of the grand cru vineyards. It is packed with yellow fruits, rich and open. This is opulence in a glass, boosted by toast and spice.",86.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A concentrated, hugely rich wine with lively caramel and toast aromas, followed by ripe fruits. It is generous and open, with apricots and nectarines giving richness, while kiwi gives the green, crisp character. The aftertaste is all minerality. Screwcap.",60.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A honeyed wine, soft and ripe. There is butter and toast, and acidity in the way of white fruits with only touches of citrus. Very round, this wine is almost ready to drink now, with its concentrated fullness and richness.",76.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Structured and tight, this is a powerful wine, dominated by wood aromas and white fruit, with spice, wood and green herb flavors. There's a smokiness that comes from the soil, and to finish, very pure green fruits.",60.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is pure mineral, chalk and lean austerity initially, but opens up with apples,  lime and green plums. It is intense, concentrated and structured; needs time. Wait 4–5 years.",65.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"The 18 acres of Château de Grenouilles are a monopoly of the La Chablisienne cooperative. A huge, ripe wine, very fruity, with yellow peaches. The richness is balanced with a steely core of minerality. Lively acidity finishes this impressive wine.",90.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is an elegant, refined style of wine, with all the elements in balance. There is wood, green and white fruits, fresh acidity and repressed power. This is a Chablis style that needs aging—give it at least 5 years.",60.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is so closed up at the moment, all mineral and steel, that it is hard to feel the ripeness of the tropical fruit. As this develops, it will flesh out the yellow fruits, balancing the acidity. The aftertaste is already thirst quenching.",60.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This tight, steely wine is austere initially, but opens up to show concentrated richness, with flavors of white currants, vivid green fruits and crisp, intense acidity. Obviously a wine that needs age—4 years at least.",30.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Very firm, this is a structured, relatively austere wine, with lots of minerality and tightness. The green fruits are  pierced with acidity, but also very fresh. A wine that needs time, give this at least 5–6 years. Screwcap.",75.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Intensity is the keyword here: the butter, toast and ripe yellow fruits are both ripe and powerful. There's some spice, balanced with acidity, finishing so fresh, young and crisp.",44.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Open, generous and relatively opulent, showing all the richness of 2005, along with peaches, apricots and tropical fruits. It's round from start to finish, a luscious Chardonnay. Just some crispness at the end.",70.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This wine shows that top Chablis should be aged. This is like tasting the barebones of the wine without the flesh that is still very hidden. There is suppressed power, as well as green acidity and potential richness. Wait 5 years.",59.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This shows how Dauvissat's wines need to age. At the moment, this is closed up, only hinting at its almost tropical richness, ripe yellow fruits and some white currants, but still kept in balance with acidity and minerality.",44.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is a wine that speaks of its terroir, the chalk soil coming out in a very mineral, austere character. It has elegance, class, great style of poise, showing acidity, fresh green fruits and a need to age for at least 5 years.",46.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Lively but rich, this balances freshness, crispness and minerality with dense, delicious fruits. There are caramel and white fruit flavors, along with intense structure. This should age for 3–4 years. Screwcap.",40.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A very vibrant, lively wine, all mineral and fresh acidity. There is some austerity  as the fruit still needs to round out; but it promises to develop well, with delicious green apple and grapefruit flavors. Keep this for 3–4 years.",32.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Steeliness exemplified in wine. This is crisp and structured, complex with its green fruits, structured acidity and touch of caramel and kiwi. It's the acidity that shows at the moment; needs 4–5 years.",34.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"There's a luscious outer edge to this wine, with mango and peach flavors freshened with citrus. But at its dense core, it is all mineral, flinty, the wood present but certainly not dominant. It needs time, maybe 3–4 years.",45.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A beautiful wine that floats its minerality, white flower aromas and white currant fruits over a foundation of toast. Freshness dominates this crisp wine, with intensity to finish.",44.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Very concentrated and closed up, like a coil. The intense green fruit is followed by plum skins. Crispness, dry but fresh, comes alongside a powerful explosion of flavors.",65.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"La Chablisienne vinifies this portion of Fourchaume premier cru separately, regarding it as almost grand cru in power. It is certainly a concentrated wine, very ripe, but lined with citrus acidity, crispness and structure. At the end, though, the richness comes out.",34.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Grapefruit and other citrus fruits come through the rich fruit. There is power and crispness here, along with a sense of structure from the mineral, flinty character that underlies the fruit. Hold for for 3–4 years.",32.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A solid, firmly structured, mineral wine, buoyed up by wood. It is very intense, nervous, just poised between richness and power. The yellow fruits, green plum skin acidity and the grapefruit crispness all blend well together.",95.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Generous in style, with great freshness. The flavors are rich, touched by caramel, ripe white currants and some spice. A fine, red apple skin structure comes through to finish.",29.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Open, generous and packed with butter and honey. Yellow fruits are the dominant character, touched with toast and ripeness. This is an opulent and full wine.",34.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Concentrated, dense, powerful and full of glistening green fruits, this wine is lightly touched with caramel, but more dominated by ripe acidity. The aftertaste is tight, suggesting good aging potential.",35.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Weighty, full-bodied, full of ripe yellow fruits. Here's a wine that is going to be a powerhouse, packed with intense flavors, touched by wood and a crisp edge. The aftertaste leaves minerality along with the ripe fruit.",65.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is the second wine from the Château Grenouilles vineyard, very fresh, but at the same time weighty and concentrated, with wood, caramel and generous fruits. Age for 5 years.",60.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is Jean-Pierre Grossot's flagship wine. From around an acre of the Mont de Milieu vineyard, he produces an intensely ripe wine that pulls toward great minerality and steeliness. There is power as well, with just touches of wood.",46.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"With 24 acres in this premier cru vineyard, Laroche is able to produce this mineral- and grapefruit-flavored wine in good quantities. There is a touch of caramel, balanced with excellent lively acidity. A fresh but full-bodied wine that will age well over the next 2–3 years. Screwcap.",33.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Made from young vines from the Vaulorent portion of the Fourchaume vineyard, this is an open, rounded and lively wine with white fruits and weight, just lifted by acidity.",45.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"There's a fine balance here between minerality and rich toast. The result is a very pure but ripe wine, dominated by a good mix of ripe white fruits and honey.",40.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Initially this is caramel and fresh fruit layered with acidity. Then the minerality kicks in with a vengeance, structuring the ripe green flavors, and leaving tense acidity.",30.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A big, toasty wine, full of ripe, delicious fruit, veering toward opulence. There are open yellow fruits along with toast and butter tastes. This is almost ready to drink now; only the acidity promises some aging.",36.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A rounded, fruity wine, packed with yellow peaches and apricots, but held in check by freshness, green herbs and a firm, steely character. It's not a wine to age for long, but it is delicious, and very seductive now.",30.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"From old vines, at least 50 years old, this shows good concentration, giving a dense, ripe, rounded wine full of green apple fruits, hints of vanilla and streaks of minerality.",23.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"For simple Chablis, this is impressive, rich, fruity, with wood as well as lively, fresh acidity. Nosings find toast and butter, with a hint of light honey.",26.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A soft, ripe, open wine with yellow fruit flavors. There is opulent concentration, velvet in texture. Only on the finish is there freshness and real acidity. Screwcap.",37.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This still tastes impressively young for a simple Chablis. In fact it isn't simple at all, showing all the intensity of a premier cru with its minerality, fresh lime and other citrus flavors, hints of honey and white fruits.",32.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A complex wine that is influenced by wood, but shows more of fresh lime and white currants. There's intense acidity, lifted green flavors and a round aftertaste.",40.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is a cool cru, which shows even in this great year with its structure, austerity and steely character. It makes it old-style Chablis, with its green fruits and lively, poised freshness.",28.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Strong minerality with crisp, clean almost mouth-puckering green fruits that show structure. It is full-bodied and rich, but also with an edge of austerity.",29.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is light and floral both with its aromas and its palate. In the heart of the wine is a firm, crisp mineral layer, which blends into the apple skin and caramel, vanilla flavors. Drink 2009.",30.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A blend from a number of premier cru vineyards, pulling together cooler and warmer sites in balance. It's fresh and light, showing elegance, green fruits and a floral character. Just a touch of minerality.",28.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A concentrated wine, just beginning to open up, with a serious, maybe austere mineral element, as well as vibrant kiwi and citrus flavors. It is softened by aging in older wood, giving some roundness to finish.",27.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"With superripe fruit, fat and glossy, with rich white fruits, round, dense and concentrated, this is a wine to ooze into the glass. It is perhaps not very Chablis, but delicious as a fine Chardonnay.",30.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"The extra amount of clay in the soil of this vineyard lends weight, richness and roundness. At the same time, it has fresh lime, an open character and a soft structure.",42.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"For a Petit Chablis, this is serious and complex, with delicious ripe green and yellow fruits; there is a touch of caramel with toast just at the edge.",28.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Named after the river that flows past Chablis, this is a ripe, fruity wine, with yellow fruit flavors and good ripeness. Unoaked, it has good concentration as well as richness.",20.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"The name “Not so little” is a joking reference to its appellation. This is a pleasure, a delicious unoaked Chardonnay with green fruits, a touch of caramel and kiwi fruit flavors.",17.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Full, in a rich style, this is a ripe wine packed with juicy green fruits. There are pears, ripe apple skins and a good citrus edge. A fresh, easily drinkable wine.",24.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A ripe, crisp, very fresh Chablis bursting with green fruits, with a light layer of caramel and green herbs. Delicious now.",22.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A fresh, simple wine, all crisp green fruit with ripe apples and a touch of grapefruit. Delicious; drink now. Screwcap.",20.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Somewhat earthy and rustic, this is a fresh wine, with citrus notes and some yeastiness. The wine's fruit has finishing liveliness and crispness.",25.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"The latest release from Salon, this just explodes in the mouth with mineral, steel and flint. The tiny mousse has flavors of yeast and just a touch of toast. It is rich, but so austere and structured. Like many Salon Champagnes, this will age for 20 years or more.",350.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"While the Larmandier's main vineyard is in Vertus, they also have a parcel in the grand cru vineyard of Cramant. It is full of beautifully ripe fruit, beginning to round out as it ages. Green fruits and white pears, as well as yeast are still dominant; drink 2010.",80.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Although this is marked nonvintage, the fruit all comes from 2004. It is made from old vines, giving richness and ripeness, and a generous white fruit character which fully compensates for the very dry nature of the wine. It's delicious, a complex wine of intense character.",62.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Based mainly on vines in Le Mesnil-sur-Oger, this impressive wine is superbly rich with just the merest hint of age. With its lively mousse, secondary aromas of mocha and flavors of green apples, it is a wine that should develop magnificently over the next 4–5 years.",61.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Made entirely from grand cru grapes, this is a beautiful wine, layering toast and ripe fruit with a proper minerality from the year. Flavors of honey, toast and nougat soften the aftertaste. It is ready to drink now, but it has still a ways to go, as the intense concentration of fruit opens out.",180.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Named not after the goddess of love, but the horse that Agrapart uses to plough the vines, this superb wine comes from 50-year-old vines, the clay   element in the soil giving richness, the minerality giving balance, lifting up the yellow fruit flavors with excellent acidity.",120.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"The 1996 vintage really brings out the minerality in a wine. This grand cru is still austere, very crisp, with some smokiness, apple-skin flavors and intense freshness. Give it another 5–6 years.",75.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"This new release from Mumm is a selection from 12 of the best vineyards owned or run by the company. It is certainly a complex wine, finely balanced with layers of intense, mature fruits, very mineral in structure, and with the crispness of the acidity acting as a support to the citrus and vanilla flavors. Worth aging for another 4–5 years.",140.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"From 90-year-old vines in Le Mesnil-sur-Oger, this is a superbly ripe wine, full-bodied, concentrated with a great swathe of minerality going through. This is still young, based on the 2004 vintage, but shows every sign of developing into a beautifully toasty maturity.",46.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"The wine is currently closed up, not offering huge flavors. So it is a question of feeling the richness, the steely edge and the yellow fruits. It is certainly very dense, needing several years' aging, finishing with vanilla creaminess.",75.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"The broad character of Bougros is evident here in this rich and creamy wine. Delicious pear and sweet grapefruit flavors combine easily with a delicate touch of wood, leaving a fine, juicy acidity.",69.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Caramel and vanilla aromas, the palate rounded, poised, with pear and green plum flavors, along with lively acidity, filled out with toast.",95.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A beautifully rounded wine, textured white fruits and fresh acidity well integrated into a rich structure. Hints of wood underline the yellow fruits and crisp, citrus, final acidity.",65.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"From what is always the Grand Cru that develops most quickly, this is a gorgeous, already very drinkable, ripe wine, certainly fresh. Maybe there is a more mineral character than usual, allied to higher acidity.",63.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"An austere wine, tight and taut, drawing a fine line of apple skins and green plum over a steely, mineral character. This is going to take its time, give it 3–4 years.",79.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A style that brings in raspberry acidity to crispen the soft fruit. A texture of red apple skins gives an edge to the wine, balanced by some final soft sweetness.",47.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A light, rather diffuse wine, with the fruit soft and ripe. The flavor of red plum juice and tomato give some sweetness, the tannins only a minor element in this ready-to-drink wine.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Light, fresh and soft, this is a perfect starter for an evening for two. It has attractive sweet lime and peach flavors, with attendant acidity.",10.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A balanced wine, with softness that indicates a relatively high dosage. There is no complexity, but the wine is light, creamy, flavored with green plums and kiwi, just edged with bitterness.",40.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"The wine is rich, packed with pear juice and minerality, laying on a tight lemon character, structured and steely, along with a rich texture that suggests the wine will be opening up over the next several years.",69.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Very mineral to start, only opening up slowly to offer a wonderful line of pure fruit. The texture is important—apple skin freshness dominant, along with spicy wood. This is for medium-term aging—4–5 years.",79.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Rounded wine, with a generous helping of acidity, it balances richness with a defiantly mineral character. There is total freshness and crispness as well as final softness.",100.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"There is an explosion of ripe yellow fruit here, giving a ripe, tropical feel. Spice, mango, it's quite a powerhouse of flavors. This is a gorgeous, opulent wine.",255.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Ripe wine, soft and weighty, the citrus element an important balancing character. Under the generosity, there is a more tautly textured wine, with acidity and flintiness. To finish, the wood shows and rounds out the fruit.",100.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Rich and soft, the yellow fruit character of this wine shines through the acidity. It has a broad texture, although never losing sight of that crispness.",47.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Balanced, a wine that has both great fruit and sweet apple acidity. Hints of spice from wood, followed by good freshness, giving a wine that is rich and crisp.",46.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A very mineral–textured wine, with a stark contrast of ripe yellow fruits, sweet vanilla and an open final flavor. The wine is certainly packed with flavors, dense, the steely edge likely to soften over the next 2–3 years.",65.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A wine that delivers great freshness, a bright lemon and grapefruit character, tautly mineral in character, almost steely, with a pure line of green fruits. Age for 2–3 years.",38.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Densely textured wine, its complex fruit and spice character offering currants, quince and green plums to go with the wood element. The wine layers fruit and a powerful dose of acidity, giving an edge to richness, never losing sight of freshness.",79.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"In a fat style, rounded and generous, yellow fruits partnering well with sweet citrus. It is full in the mouth, only at the end showing its intense acidity, hints of almonds and orange zest.",110.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Full and fresh, a beautifully rich wine, packed with tropical fruits, ripe apricots and a gorgeous opulent texture. Impressive.",50.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Balanced, a wine that shows the right richness, spice, great wafts of fresh plums, peaches, lifted by acidity and rounded by a fine wood element.",30.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Tight and mineral wine, with a great citrus character, fresh green fruits broadened by wood toast, while the acidity is as crisp as possible. It has a youthful apple skin texture, and would repay a couple of years' aging.",35.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A good contrast between weighty, rich fruit and a steely structure. White fruits and acidity offer freshness, while the more austere edge gives the wine a serious, solid character. For aging.",75.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A rounded wine, with a counterpoint of apple skin texture, the fruit flavors offering acidity as well as green plums. The texture is plush, velvet, delicious.",69.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This tastes lean, the fruit buried deep beneath hard, dry fruit tannins. There is an old style austerity here that demands food. The final juicy acidity does leave a welcome relief.",24.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A very soft wine that just hints at a crisp food character. Everything is there—the fruit, acidity and a tight texture—but the wine overall shows an indistinct, unfocused character.",45.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Certainly soft, as befits a pure Merlot wine, with smoky tannins and cranberry fruit juice flavors. There is a coolness to the wine, heightened by the acidity, a product of the vintage.",10.00,Bordeaux,Merlot
"A wine that seems to be all tannin, all wood, with only a feel of black currant fruits underneath all this dryness. These flavors suggest high extraction, giving spice, a high toast wood character, all too much for a delicate 2007.",11.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Very light, just hinting at tannins, this is an easy, soft wine, the black berry juice fruit flavors the main taste element. The wine has a jammy, smoky character that comes through, but the texture remains dilute.",16.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Rounded and ripe, with a fine streak of fresh acidity, the wine is bright, and lively, the final taut texture giving a delicious frisson.",50.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Balanced, soft wine, keeping its freshness and acidity, rounding it out with some wood and pear juice flavors. A fine, classic wine.",57.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Youthful yeasty aromas appear at this early stage, the palate showing the same character. The fruit is firm and structured, the acidity very marked along with its tense mineral character. For aging.",69.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Initially soft, this wine then reveals a firmer structure, and a salty and mineral texture. There is an element of toastiness, rounding out the crisp apple and citrus fruit flavors. A cool, elegant wine.",60.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A smooth and concentrated wine, very rich. Peach and nectarine fruits dominate, the acidity coming from a crisp citrus streak. The wine could benefit from another year in bottle to reveal its true intensity.",25.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Spicy, toasty wine, the fruit tropically rich. The texture is dense, the acidity important but not dominant. Delicious wine, now maturing well.",27.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Full, rounded wine starring creamed apples and pink grapefruit acidity. The wine is crisp, fresh, with a firm texture and lively acidity.",41.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A lean, somewhat austere wine that emphasizes tight tannins and minerality. The fruit is firm, but at the same time both slightly oxidized and edging towards green. The result is a set of flavors that definitely demands food.",22.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Attractively made, but uncomplicated wine, with fresh raspberries, acidity, a light tannic coating, maybe spoilt by a rustic edge. Drink now.",16.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The wine starts soft, light and delicate, with some toast as well as creamy fruit. But that fruit goes fast, leaving a Champagne that has a high dosage, giving an aftertaste that is more sweet than fresh. This really should be better.",22.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
The acidity dominates this super-fresh wine. The red currant juice flavor is mixed with candied lemon and a soft texture.,80.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Very soft and unfocused, this is in a full style, flavored with pink grapefruit and sweet lime. But it feels heavy in the mouth, obviously working better with food, but also showing signs of the sugar in the dosage.",68.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A bitter wine, revealing some hard, extracted tannins. The fruit is tight, slightly green, although there are also attractive flavors of wild strawberries. The finish is marked by unbalanced sweetness.",55.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A Merlot-dominated wine, soft, fresh, the tannins a whisper under red berry fruits. This simple freshness is spoilt by a dirty edge to the acidity, giving a final bitterness.",15.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A relatively full-bodied wine, ripe and smothered in raspberry jam. It has a layer of banana flavor, acidity and even some tannin. It's like drinking red berry juice.",16.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"A well-made, tightly structured wine emphasizing tannins and berry fruits. It would almost be worth aging, with its weight and dry texture. The fruit is solid and firm.",12.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"Initially this one seems very dry, then richer black fruits come through, providing some weight. It finishes deliciously fruity.",15.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"On the dry side, showing some lean tannins with the fruit and banana. There's a serious side to this wine and it needs a few minutes to breathe before offering up its ripe fruits and final jammy sweetness.",10.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"The ripe aromas are the sign of a wine that is rich, weighty and intense. This is a vinous Champagne, rich in full-bodied yellow and white fruits, definitely suggesting rich foods. Ten years on, it is developing well, but could be cellared for several more years.",80.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A wine that shows perhaps too much tannin for a Nouveau, and will probably be more accessible next year. It has a tight side, with the acidity fitting well into the ripe plum flavors.",13.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"A fat style with good berry fruits and tannins. The fresh acidity is of course present, but fits well with the raspberry and cherry flavors. Screwcap.",13.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"This has weight and some rich fruit. On top of this are ripe tannins, bananas and black cherry flavors. The acidity is present but balanced.",11.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"Crisply fresh, this shows some of the weight of 2009. It's a wine that has attractive red fruits, acidity and a good depth of bright tannins. The aftertaste features banana and spice.",13.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"Light and fruity, this is a wine that flows easily and softly. Bright acidity and some weight broaden out the red plum and raspberry fruits.",8.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"The tannins and acidity complement each other well, but the ensemble is overly influenced by the strong banana flavor. The berry acidity and the concentration helps restore the balance.",12.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"A wine that has some weight and good berry fruits. There is some concentration of red plums and strawberries, and the tannins and acidity are well under control. Banana comes through in the aftertaste.",10.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"A real alternative to red Beaujolais Nouveau. An intense strawberry flavored wine, with acidity and freshness. It has some weight as well, but mainly it is bright and lively.",10.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"Strawberry flavors dominate the intense acidity and fresh fruit. There is a banana flavor that gives it sweetness, the light tannins just offering some contrast.",13.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"As with many Beaujolais Nouveau in 2009, the color here is dark, a bubbly purple. The fruit though is somewhat lean, the acidity too prominent. The wine has a deal of banana and redcurrant fruits.",10.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"A total bubble gum wine, from the first aromas right through the palate. That character gives sweetness to the acidity, and less obvious redcurrant flavors.",10.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"If you need convincing of the true potential of the La Clape region of Languedoc, look no futher. This is a delicate yet complex wine of true character and depth with a beautiful bouquet of rich dark fruit, tea leaves, leather and menthol. The mouth, smooth and lush, is loaded with intense plum, cherry, spice and pepper. The balance is fantastic, making this an easy wine to enjoy now or an excellent candidate to hold for 3–5 years.",63.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Exploding with perfumes, aromas of violets, sweet cherries and spice, this is an impressive wine, with wild cherries and damson plums. It is taut, almost Pinot Noir in its velvet texture, finishing with ripe, sweet fruit sustained by tannins.",35.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"A more serious attempt at crafting a good Pinot Noir in Languedoc-Roussillon and quite a successful one as well. Vanilla dominates the nose but yields to cherry pie filling and cherry jam flavors in the mouth. Mineral and strawberry notes shine through on the crisp, moderately long finish.",13.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Pinot_Noir
The winemaking team of Château Lafite makes one of the better branded Bordeaux. This 2006 has tobacco aromas followed by flavors of fresh black currants with an attractive smoky character and a fine line of balancing acidity.,45.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Perfumed, earthy, spicy, this is a balanced wine that brings its tannins firmly together with black fig, black plum skins and sweet juicy black cherries. The core is dry, but the delicious fruit finally dominates. That said, it is sure to have some good aging.",20.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"Although initially austere, this wine then opens out well, giving a firm and structured character. There are spice, solid dry tannins and a fine layer of berry fruits, finishing off with lively acidity.",19.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A solid, structured Bordeaux. It shows black berry fruit flavors, lifted by acidity and rounded with dark plum, dry spice and firm tannins. There's a fine, juicy richness to the finish, which leaves fruit and dry tannins firmly in place.",13.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"With 80% Syrah, 20% Grenache and 15 months in oak, this is a big, powerful wine loaded with rich fruit and sultry spice. Dark cherry, cigar box, cinnamon and cardamom abound on the nose, with more kirsch, pepper and allspice unfolding on the palate. Creamy and lush in the mouth with a long, evolving finish full of mocha and dark chocolate-covered cherries. Delicious now or hold for 2-3 years.",35.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This is the top wine from Château Haute-Serre, a powerful expression of Malbec, very dense and solid, but certainly not overpowering. It has ripe fruit that is held in check by brooding tannins and a firm structure, giving it weight but also surprising restraint. Age for 4–5 years.",45.00,Southwest_France,Malbec
"A straightforward, superb value wine perfect for a roast or rack of whatever dinner with friends. Lively and balanced with beautiful red fruit flavors accented by notes of olive and licorice on the finish. With 900 cases produced, grab what you can but enjoy it soon.",8.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Red_Blend
"Crisp grapefruit and citrus character, with tight lime zest acidity. While the wine is full in the mouth, it has the brightest acidity, pear juice and a final pepper burst.",12.00,Loire_Valley,Melon
"Another great value from The Humble Winemaker, producer of the Arrogant Frog wines. Raspberry and blueberry flavors abound with accents of cocoa and foliage. Lightweight but round and well structured with a moderate finish.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Pinot_Noir
"Fine and fresh, this has clean fruit, a touch of caramel along with crisp white peach and creamy apple. The wine is light, soft, accessible now.",21.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay

"Yeasty on the nose, with very crisp green acidity and flavors of citrus and grapefruit. A delicious example of the Aligoté grape, it is a light, ready-to-drink wine for oysters or white fish.",28.00,Burgundy,Aligoté
"Sweet, strawberry jelly aromas lead to a wine that shows ripe, spiced and red plum flavors lifted by definite wood characters. The acidity is a constant right through this attractive wine.",14.00,Burgundy,Gamay
"A balanced and straightforward wine boasting strong dark fruit flavors of black cherry and berry along with accents of milk chocolate and licorice. Medium weight with a soft structure, approachable tannins and a clean finish. Drink now.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"As the name suggests, this wine is loaded with herbal notes of the garrigue in the form of a Southern France bouquet garni—rosemary, thyme and menthol—alongside accents of red currant and cherry. Nicely balanced and vibrant on the palate with a medium-length finish.",7.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Red_Blend
"Fresh, fruity and inviting, here's an easygoing, ready-to- drink Corbières with strong red fruit flavors of cherry and plum and hints of garrigue. Light weight, soft tannins and balanced acidity make this a crowd pleaser that's sure to pair well with most meat or game-based dishes. Drink now.",12.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Red_Blend
"Crisp, dry, light wine, its freshness coming from redcurrant fruits. A gentle caramel overlay gives extra weight.",15.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"A tight wine, the acidity and green pepper character very prominent. It is definitely a food wine, the dry tannins just ready to cut through rich meat. On its own, it is packed with a fruit salad of red berry fruits.",10.00,Loire_Valley,Red_Blend
"A lightweight wine, very crisp and citrusy, floating easily with attractive freshness. The fruit comes over with some good apple skin textures and a vibrant, bright aftertaste.",12.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is delicious white Burgundy. The fruit is lively, crisp, lemony, while the texture is rounded, just tight enough to give structure, but open enough to be relaxed. The finish offers just a hint of spice.",22.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Impressively ripe and dense, with maple syrup and citrus characters giving a delicious, full wine. Kiwi and green plum dominate the fruit, while the concentrated underlying structure gives a soft cushion of richness.",34.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A somewhat simple though well-balanced wine with scents of baby powder, cocoa dust, black cherry and raspberry. The palate shows a bit more heft with notes of purple flowers and soft plum guts. Juicy and approachable with soft tannins and a medium-length finish.",16.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"With 40% Grenache, 40% Syrah, 20% Carignan and no oak aging, this is a fresh and juicy wine with characteristics of black cherry, black berry, thyme, Asian spice and cola. Solid acidity and a medium finish make this an easy pleaser.",17.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend

"Like many of Denis Pommier's wines, this comes from old vines, and the concentration is testament to that. The texture is rich, touched by honeyed wood, with peaches in syrup ripeness. As a contrast, there is also a fresh, red apple acidity, which gives a lift to the aftertaste.",34.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This tense, crisp wine is all green fruit, very straight, very fresh. Apple, pink grapefruit and almonds come together in a wine that has no complexity, but offers plenty of pleasure.",33.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"On the tart side, emphasizing grapefruit rather than riper citrus and with a definite texture of very green apple skins. Initially this is too crisp for its own good, but then with seafood, it works well. Screwcap.",22.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Though not terribly complex or exciting, this is a well-made Minervois with soft red fruit and kirsch aromas backed by hints of spice and light floral characters. Approachable tannins and light acidity followed by a short, clean finish make this an easy-to-drink and enjoyable selection.",12.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Ripe black plum and berry dominate the nose and mouth on this Merlot, with appropriate accents of coffee granules and black pepper to spice things up. Lightweight but round with a medium-length finish.",9.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot
"A great selection for those seeking an affordable organically grown Merlot. Ripe red berries along with notes of mocha and spearmint unfold on the nose, while red plum and cherry take center stage in the mouth. With solid structure and good balance, this is sure to be a crowd pleaser.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot

Dusty tannins flesh out the palate and the finish offers some mild black pepper spice.",13.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Pinot_Noir
"For a Petit-Chablis, this has plenty of firm, tight structure. While the fruit is light, it is based on a texture of sweet caramel and plums, freshened with acidity. The finish is rich and soft.",33.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Tight green apple and citrus acidity dominates this wine. It is very crisp, at this stage too crisp, and the structure is on the lean side. It certainly reflects the cool growing conditions of 2007.",47.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Light and crisp, this is a fresh style of wine without much weight. There are a toast element from wood, some green berry structure, flavors of white currants, and tight acidity. The finish shows citrus and high toast. Screwcap.",35.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Tasting light, almost dilute, this is a pleasant wine with white fruit flavors and a light textured acidity. The flavors come slowly and the final acidity is only fleeting.",24.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay

"Fresh, light, creamy Chardonnay, just a touch of vanilla with crisp, clean green fruits. There is an attractive touch of spice to round the wine off.",19.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This was a good year in Chablis, a breath of freshness after the impressive, powerful 2005, but a vintage that still has weight and intensity. This Chablis shows all that, with an extra dimension of spice, nuts and a tight apple-skin structure leading to a fresh finish.",33.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Following an unfortunate Chanson white wine style, this wine is totally dominated by new, high toast wood. It shows freshness, but the acidity comes from the wood, leaving the structured fruit way behind.",105.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Light, creamy Chardonnay, with vivid lemon and green plum flavors. Fresh and lightly yeasty, its fruit is right up front, and with the vanilla from wood aging far in the background. Drink now.",26.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Irancy produces lightweight Pinot Noir, emphasizing the freshest raspberry flavors, allied to soft, dry tannins. There is a smoky element here that is attractive. The finish, with its acidity, shows the crispness of this northern production area.",20.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A bit muted and simple but easy to drink with a lightweight mouth and soft aromas and flavors of red plum, cherry and currant along with hints of spice on the finish.",11.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Red_Blend
"This wine runs the gamut of crisp, mineral flavors. It is tight, driven by green flavors and acidity, with just a touch of vanilla. As befits a Petit Chablis, there is lightness rather than weight, but it makes a delicious aperitif style of wine.",19.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"In a piece of French wine shorthand, the new appellation of Saint-Bris takes in the old Sauvignon de Saint-Bris wines. The style, though, hasn't changed: an attractive, if rustic type, with crisp gooseberry and grapefruit flavors and a fresh burst of acidity. Screwcap.",13.00,Burgundy,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A creamy, vanilla- and ripe fruit-flavored wine. Apricot and melon fruit flavors dominate, with new wood and a delicate layer of crisp, clean acidity. Drink now.",26.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay

"This soft wine focuses on white fruits, pears and a creamy texture. The acidity is there, with a touch of minerality, but with its simple, easy flavors, this makes a great aperitif.",26.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"The bright and inviting nose is loaded with lively red fruit, including raspberries and cherries, along with a soft hint of vanilla. Incredibly lightweight with soft fruit flavors; easy to drink.",13.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot
"Smells a little warm with notes of stewed red berries and brandied cherries. Lightweight with medium acidity and virtually no tannins—this is an easy-to-drink option; given the Tetra-pak packaging, a great choice for concerts, camping and picnics.",5.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Pinot_Noir
"Fatter than any Loire Sauvignon Blanc, this has some rich fruit, flavors of currants, an oily texture and intriguing candy flavors. There is a structure of green apple skins, but the wine is essentially light, fresh and instantly pleasing.",10.00,Burgundy,Sauvignon_Blanc
Fairly confectioned for the style with flavors of dried red cherry and candied strawberry. Lightweight with soft structure and a mild finish.,10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Pinot_Noir

"Lively and vibrant with aromas of juicy red fruit, banana, bubblegum and carnation. Light in body and flavor in the mouth with a thin, short finish.",8.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Red_Blend

"Stunning aromas of orange, clove and gingerbread follow through to a dense palate with intriguing notes of white chocolate and honey. The high level of sweetness is effectively countered by bright acidity. Serve with a mousse of foie gras.",61.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"While there is certainly plenty of wood here, the wine has weight and impressive concentration for the year. The tannins are still brooding away, giving a dark firm character to the wine. Blackberry fruits and acidity are there, but still well buried in the tannins.",850.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"With its perfumed aromas, this is a wine that has richness and sweetness, with soft velvet power. It has an intense wood element that needs to blend into the rest of the wine, but the sweet black currant and freshness provide a good balance. This is a seductive wine, with a fine solid character.",120.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A big and powerful wine, with tannins that are compact and dense. The dryness of the tannins go right to the core, surrounded by chocolate, sweet fruit and dark berry flavors. The wine is well structured, big and bold, with plenty of firmness promising aging.",500.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The wood element is important here, but it is based on a firm Cabernet Sauvignon structure, dry but rich tannins. The wine is a great success for the vintage, giving sweetness, ripe fruit that only shows light extraction, and dark plum and berry flavors. The feeling is of polished fruit and wood, rounded but always dense.",450.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This is a great success for the year, a wine that is dense, characterized by balance between sweet fruit and solid tannins. Spice from the finely judged wood aging adds extra complexity, as do the plum and berry fruits. For aging.",65.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"For the year, this is a big wine, a success. New wood flavors and tannins blend well with the weight of fruit, depth of flavor and concentration. The wine has freshness to give with the structure, solid and intense. Certainly for aging—five years and more.",160.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"It is easy to be seduced by the opulence of this wine. But underneath the ripe surface, there is a complex wine, full of tight, structured yellow fruits, spice from wood and acidity bursting to get out. It needs at least another four years for its real grandeur to be apparent.",70.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"A serious wine, filled with firm tannins, spiced with wood, and layered with bitter coffee as well as fruit. It certainly has power, the structure ready for long aging, firmly anchored in the dense character of this wine. It is a medium aging wine, 5–10 years.",450.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"With its head-turning aromas of honey, truffles and ripe peaches, this is a knockout offfering from Tardieu Laurent. In the mouth, it's broad yet focused, with layers of rich, nuanced flavors that coat the palate before ending in a long, mineral-inflected finish. Drink now-2020, and possibly beyond that.",82.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"This is a wine for aging. The tannins are dense, very dry with a feel of extraction. It takes a while for the black currant fruit to show through, with acidity and freshness dominant. The wine is still settling, and time will bring the fruit into line with the tannins.",455.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A standout in the impressive Ehrhart range, the nose explodes with lime and petrol. Citrus fruit is intense on the palate, interwoven with lower mineral tones that linger nicely on the long finish. A real stunner.",33.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Cotton candy notes overlap with licorice and spice aromas to create a very enticing bouquet. The luxurious, concentrated palate serves up flavors of brown sugar and honey. Set aside a good amount of time to enjoy the finish.",50.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"Slowly the potential of this impressive wine is coming out. It is rich, the new wood flavors blending with the ripe blackberry sweetness and tight tannins. Chocolate flavor power through this concentrated wine.",75.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A smooth, velvet textured wine, piled high with sweet, ripe flavors. There is fine, opulent concentration here, impressive density, and a solid, tannic core. While it is not as powerful as some vintages from this estate, it certainly suggests the ability to age 5–6 years and more.",360.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A ripe wine, with a delicious citrus and pear character, sweet fruits and an edge of spice. Pineapple acidity gives both richness and freshness. The wine has both balance and final acidity.",580.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"A solidly structured wine, filled with fig, bitter coffee, spice and wood over a firm structure of tannins. The freshness is quite intense, but the ripe fruit is vivid with layered acidity and new wood. This is a serious wine, for aging.",210.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A very powered wine, pushing forward with solid, but always fresh structure and fruit. The wine bursts with ripe jammy fruits, but is also firmly tannic. It combines sweet weight with final extreme, exuberant freshness.",95.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A dark charactered wine, with solid tannins and firm, extracted fruit flavors. The berry fruits are juicy and sweet, with the dusty tannins coming from the Cabernet in the blend. The finish is softer, more black jelly in texture.",90.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"With plenty of new wood, the wine has a velvet character, smooth and round. Only gradually does a plum skin, bitter chocolate element come in, giving structure and weight. This is a wine that should age well.",55.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Firm, solid, chunky, a great success from a château that is currently in top form, even in more difficult years. The bright fruits charge through the tannins, giving some richness, balancing with the elegance and freshness of the year. Worth aging.",50.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Silky wine, fresh and light, balanced with high acidity cutting through black berry fruits. The structure has some substance, but this is a light, aromatic wine, developing fast, already delicious, and only for medium-term aging.",450.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Guigal's luxury cuvée from Condrieu is a blend of vineyards, all vinified and agfed for eight months in new oak. The result is a big, spicy, rich wine, graced with smoky nuances but built on concentrated honey and apricots. It's long and powerful on the finish, ending with impressive spice. Drink now-2015.",100.00,Rhône_Valley,Viognier
"Jaboulet's white Hermitage is a huge success in 2007, boasting somewhat restrained aromas of pineapple, but tremendous structure and length. It's full-bodied, with a finish laced with crushed stone and citrus. Try it around 2017.",85.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"Rich, impressively ripe fruit, the fruit dense and black, with juicy black plum flavors followed by dusty tannins. The wine is chunky, powerful for the year, the dryness smoothed by new wood.",75.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Cornas is Colombo's home turf, and the 2005 Terres Brulees shows his mastery, offering up beefy, cedary notes but also cracked pepper and cassis alongside iron-like mineral notes. This is full-bodied and intense, with plenty of structure; drink 2015-2025.",78.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah

"A full-bodied, richly textured example of Hermitage, Belle's '04 starts off with scents of crushed stones, then adds flavors of melon and pear to the mix. It lingers elegantly on the finish. Drink now-2020.",107.00,Rhône_Valley,Marsanne
"A strong effort from Meffre, the '07 Laurus Hermitage features exotic aromas of honey, ripe peaches and even a bit of black truffle. This full-bodied, opulent example of Hermitage should be consumed in its youth to best enjoy its flamboyant style of honeyed ripeness.",57.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"Although one could wish for more aromatic complexity in a Vendanges Tardives, notes of lemon poppy-seed cake are very satisfying. The intense, layered palate shows notes of candied fruit and spice and leads to a long, lush finish.",50.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"Spice and blackberry jelly fruits give a wine that has attractive fruity, ripe Cabernet tannins, acidity, but not a huge structure. There is great freshness, but maybe the wine as a whole is a little lean.",90.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A big, bitter chocolate and new wood-dominated wine, the wine's spice coming from wood and also fig and cocoa flavors. There is acidity, and fresh berry fruits coming through the dark, black character.",70.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"On the oaky side, even for Colombo, but charged with superripe fruit as well, Force One makes a statement. Blackberries are slathered with chocolate and vanilla overtones, there's a rich, lush texture in the mouth, and the finish is long and mouthwatering. Drink now-2020.",137.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"This is a solid effort, impressively powerful, the tannins and extract just right for the fruit. The flavors are juicy, but the backbone is right there, the aftertaste dark and dense. Certainly likely to age.",75.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Big and bold for the year, the tannins quite solid with a tight character. The fruit flavors are rich and intense, spiced with toast and acidity. Through it all goes the tell-tale 2007 streak of acidity.",100.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A wine with plenty of weight, fruit and balanced tannins. It shows a smoky character from the toasty wood, followed by broad berry fruits and sweetness. The ripe fruit flows naturally from the tannins, both offering aging potential.",70.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
The very reliable but little-known house of Ehrhart turns in a true stunner with this Riesling from the Schlossberg vineyard. Subtle but gorgeously complex notes of honey and orange peel serve as the opening act. The off-dry palate displays intense notes of ginger and candied fruit. This wine is both powerful and pure.,35.00,Alsace,Riesling
"There is good density here, a wine that seems well balanced and integrated. It has a solid, firm kernel, but this is balanced with great fresh acidity as well as blackberry fruits. The wine still seems to be coming together after bottling, and certainly needs 4–5 years.",180.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Already the velvet texture is broadening out to give a wine that shows solid fruits, bright and sweet, never heavy, but with plenty of ripeness and polish. Inside this suave character, there is a core of tight tannins, promising medium-term aging.",55.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Definite tannins here, a wine that shows ripe fruits, richness and a solid core. It is not huge, but does have structure, bitter chocolate, sweetness. It's worth aging this wine 3–4 years.",40.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The wood that dominated during the futures tastings in 2008 has calmed down, merging more easily into the rich fruits. There is an attractive smoky character, focused berry flavors and delicious spice. It should age well over 3–5 years.",35.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Made only from Roussanne, one might expect a dramatically different style of Hermitage. But not so much. Like other Hermitage's, this is broad, full bodied and lushly textured, without much in the way of distinctive fruit aromas. Long and mouthwatering on the finish. Unknown aging potential.",70.00,Rhône_Valley,Roussanne
"With a high proportion of Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a structured wine, the freshness coming from intense blackberries. Spice and bitter coffee flavors mingle with the tannins, promising some good aging for the vintage.",50.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A wine with some density, spiced with touches of wood, dusty tannins and an open sweet plum flavor. There is plenty of wood here, layering the fruit. The wine has aging potential, worth waiting 4–5 years.",45.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This is a delicious wine already, not powerful, but charming and elegant. The acidity and fruit are easy and bright, the tannins light but properly in balance. That suggests this is not for aging. It's already a pleasure to drink now.",50.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A perfumed, finely structured wine, with firm, dusty tannins. The wood is well-balanced with acidity and some generous weight, finishing with black fruits and intense freshness.",50.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Chocolate and solid fruit flavors in this exemplary wine. It is rich, the tannins balancing with blackberry fruit flavors. The density of the texture suggests good medium-term aging.",28.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A dense wine, very much in the line of powerful wines from Haut-Bailly. Flavors of bitter chocolate, sweet berry fruits and richness are dominant, the acidity a fine balancing act to give a burst of freshness.",58.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Meffre's wines can be a bit variable, but this Condrieu is top shelf, starting from its seductive aromas of honey, apricot and truffle to its lingering, elegant finish. In between, it's lush and mouthcoating without being overblown. Drink now-2012.",59.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"This wonderfully perfumed St.-Péray combines scents of tangerine, with hints of hiney, truffle and peach. Then the ripe citrus and peach flavors take hold, coating the mouth with breadth and intensity and a leaving a slightly mineral-saline finish. Drink now-2012.",42.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"Very few Crozes manage to be mini-Hermitages, but this one succeeds admirably. Honeyed ripeness comes through, along with scents of truffle and anise in this full-bodied white, and although the finish shows a bit of toasty oak at this stage, the fruit sings longest and loudest in the end. Drink now-2020.",44.00,Rhône_Valley,Marsanne
"This is a solid, finely perfumed wine, the tannins giving concentration and structure. There is some severity as well, a sign that it is still settling into the bottle. But with its bitter chocolate character and tight texture, it should age well.",45.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A wine that is dominated by wood at this stage in its development. But the structure and the fruit are all there, waiting to slot into place in the next 2–3 years. Spice and bright black berry flavors layer with final acidity.",130.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Despite being 90% Grenache, this luxury cuvée seems destined to age, buttressed by firm tannins and crisp acids. Black cherry and plum aromas carry a note of sur-maturité and hints of dusty earth, leather and spice. The finish is long, loaded with lingering chocolate and licorice nuances. Try after 2012.",69.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Like many 2005s from the northern Rhone, Colombo's Les Ruchets needs time. The tannins dominate the mouth right now, but the black olive and peppered-meat nuances win out in the end, adding depth to tarry, leathery notes and plummy fruit. Try after 2015.",88.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"A great success, with its concentration, solid tannins and black, bitter cherry fruit flavors. The wine has spice, licorice and some layers of wood. Certainly, this would be worth aging for 4–5 years.",45.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Think of this wine as a tough, ornery relative who shows great depth once you get to know him. Leather, chocolate and prune notes mark the aromas and flavors, and the wine shows some alcoholic warmth and drying tannins. But the class shows through on the finish, which is long and richly textured. Give it at least another five years in the cellar.",95.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"The blended white from Beaucastel is every bit as enjoyable right now as the more expensive Vieilles Vignes bottling, offering more generous notes of honeyed oranges, a rich, weighty mouthfeel and a long, harmonious finish. Drink now.",105.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"A bouquet of summer desserts—strawberry soup, apricot pie and lemon meringue pie—pull you into the glass. Although not quite as nuanced, the palate delivers enticing apricot and wet stone notes. The unctuous palate and noticeable residual sugar will partner well with fish in an Asian-fusion preparation.",22.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Sexy aromas of expensive perfume, exotic spices and honey give way to a strikingly intense palate accented by caramelized apple notes. Finish is long and a bit sweet. Serve this luxurious wine with lobster in a fruit preparation.",31.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"Offers developed aromas of brioche and dried apricots, with hints of mineral. The intense palate is viscous but the finish is dry. Drink with complex fish dishes.",27.00,Alsace,Riesling
"This is in Pommery's relatively delicate style, a finely balanced, elegant Champagne. It has some lively acidity; the balance between this and the white fruits and touch of maturity works. Great non-vintage.",42.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A full wine, soft and creamy, with some toasty, yeast character. There's obvious Pinot Noir character, with flavors of white fruits, pink grapefruit and a ripe structure.",40.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Fully rounded, and crisply dry, this has a great foamy, creamy texture, filled out with red apple skins, pink grapefruit and an open aftertaste. Is the aftertaste just a touch sweet? Perhaps, but that seems to be part of the balance, and not out of place.",37.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Guigal is now making 40-45% of the entire Condrieu appellation, making the quality of this cuvée quite an achievement. Floral notes lead off, followed by hints of peach, apricot and honey, and the wine walks the requisite balance between round lushness and peppery, minerally spice. Drink now-2012.",55.00,Rhône_Valley,Viognier
"Aged in a combination of one- and two-year-old oak and stainless steel, Guigal's 2007 Saint-Joseph is round in the mouth yet minerally at the same time, with graphite notes supporting the voluminous pear and melon fruit, right through the lengthy finish.",30.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"The wine has developed well, with plenty of weight, but the fruit seems a little diffuse, soft, open in character. It's masking the tannin core, a wine that opens slowly and carefully.",55.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A smooth wine, rich for the vintage, with black currant and bright fruits and a strong underlay of wood. The acidity, though, is quite striking, with the freshest fruit and tight tannins.",140.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This all-Roussanne cuvée is a broad, fat wine that somehow pulls itself together to deliver a long, mineral- and spice-tinged finish. Some nice pineapple fruit holds it together through the midpalate. Has a reputation for aging well, so this score may seem conservative in five years' time.",182.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"With its dusty tannins and bright fruits, this fully represents the vintage. It has a texture that is open, relatively gentle, powered by black currants and very accessible. The acidity gives a light lift at the end.",45.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A smooth, polished wine, with acidity, sweet fruit and a range of dusty tannins, with acidity. This is an accomplished, delicious wine that is developing fast, and seems only for medium-term aging.",60.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Starts with a blast of liqueur-like black cherries and raisin, then adds dustings of cinnamon and clove to give it a modicum of complexity. Lush, creamy in texture and mouthfilling, it's a fine Châteauneuf-du-Pape for near-term enjoyment.",40.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Despite being rather full-bodied, this isn't soft at all, instead offering up scents of lime and lemon and firm, assertive flavors of apple and citrus. Finishes crisp and long. This could work as a mouthwatering apéritif or perhaps with raw shellfish.",12.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Made in the traditional Hugel style, this is a dry, high-acid Riesling. Scents of lime and chalk dust combine with green apple and petrol aromas to make for a classic bouquet. Modernists may find the palate a bit lean, but others will find it sharply focused, with a racy, zesty finish.",18.00,Alsace,Riesling
"A light, dry style of Pinot Blanc, with apple, melon and mineral hints backed by citrus and wet stones that finish crisp and dry. As prices for Riesling and Pinot Gris have edged upward, Pinot Blanc has remained the bargain variety of Alsace, and this is a solid example, best served as an apéritif or with light fish dishes.",11.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"A fruit-forward, friendly wine that boasts admirably concentrated cassis and blackberry flavors. It's medium-bodied, with enough supple tannin to accompany burgers and the like.",9.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
"The Vouvray-based négociant, Marc Brédif, has made a ripe, soft Chinon, reveling in the sweet fruit of 2005. It has some good, smoked-meat flavors to go with the black fruits. Drink now.",21.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"For consumers seeking inexpensive yet varietally true wines, Tortoise Creek has scored with the 2005 vintage. The Merlot may be the richest and longest of their red wine offerings, with impressive black cherry aromas backed by flavors of blackberry and espresso. Drink now.",9.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot
"A very floral wine, poised and creamy. Already there is an almond character as the wine develops, but it still hasn't lost sight of the initial fresh green fruits. Drink now; it will only develop slightly.",75.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"It's good that Pommery has given this wine some bottle age, despite the young image the label suggests. The result is dry, but with less fruit and more secondary toast and nut flavors, a finely textured wine. It also has some weight, which balances the acidity well.",50.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is the palest of pinks. To taste, also, it is more a white than a rosé. There's just that touch of structure to add complexity to the deliciously fresh green-apple fruit flavors.",70.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"For those who like their non-vintage with some bottle age, this is a fine wine. While it has lost its early freshness, it certainly has gained in complexity, offering ripe, soft, toasty flavors to add to the green plum fruits and acidity.",50.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Lively white fruit with a mineral edge. The flavors are just showing some signs of mature toast, but at the moment green, crisp tastes predominate. The sweet dosage —relatively high—seems to need time to integrate.",40.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Pretty approachable for a 2005 Cornas, with a lush texture that carries superripe plum fruit, toasty oak and hints of espresso bean. Vanilla and dried spices come through loud and clear on the finish. Drink now-2018.",88.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Very perufmed and pretty, this is a long, silky mouthful of Syrah. Complex floral elements lead the way, tined with herbal overtones, but there is also ample cherry fruit supported by underpinnings of vanilla. Drink now-2015.",42.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"A solid value from the Northern Rhône, the 2007 Petite Ruche is a broad, mouthfilling wine that doesn't go over the top. Instead, the honey, peach and citrus notes gain focus on the slightly oily finish, picking up hints of truffle along the way. Drink now.",25.00,Rhône_Valley,Marsanne
"A subtly wood aged wine, the white fruit flavor giving an extra dimension with a touch of honey. It has all the direct, delicious fruit of 2007, the wine then rounded out with nutmeg and soft acidity.",21.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Impressively ripe fruit, with smoky flavors from wood, the texture sweet and fleshy. The wine has juicy berry flavors, with the freshest acidity, livened with spice from the fruit and the oak aging. Worth aging for 5–10 years.",55.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A bargain from Costières de Nîmes, this barrel-fermented white is creamy in texture, yet crisp enough on the finish to retain a sense of balance. Hints of honey and truffle mark the pear and pineapple flavors, with touches of coffee and smoke thrown into the mix as well. Drink now.",17.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"An impressively intense wine, concentrated and solid. The fruits are firm and tannic, with a new wood element that seems well in balance. A good success for the year.",30.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A noteworthy effort made in widely available commercial quantities, Guigal's '07 CdR Blanc offers scents of pineapple and pear, flavors that include hints of white chocolate, a reasonably rich mouthfeel and a long, dry, concentrated finish with just a hint of honey.",14.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"This intriguing wine displays an almost fumé-style smoky minerality on the nose, followed by flavors of pear and toast. It's a focused, medium-bodied blend of 50% Marsanne and 50% Roussanne, with a finish that won't quit.",32.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"Peachy and spicy, floral yet mineral, this clean, pure expression of Viognier fruit and Condrieu terroir is a delicious marriage. Drink now.",75.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"On the toasty, oaky side, but with just enough citrus and melon fruit to support it, this is a creamy, lush rendition of Saint-Péray that does a nice job integrating the oak into the body of the wine. The final impression is one of harmony and elegance. Drink now-2012.",40.00,Rhône_Valley,Marsanne-Roussanne
"An intense and concentrated wine that succeeds well. It has plenty of freshness, but also sufficient firm tannins to offer aging potential. Wood is prominent, but not dominant, finishing with the freshest of berry fruits.",35.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Very modern and polished in style, this wine goes for the soft, juicy fruit characters. The tannins are sweet, equally soft, already delicious in character, finishing with smoky cranberry and black currant flavors.",40.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Powered by wood and tight fruits, this is a wine with some potential. The tannins are solid, foursquare, but the fruit is ready to fill out the structure with sweetness and perfume. There is a final rich, juicy black currant character.",25.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Fresh berry fruits, light tannins and stalky black currants, sustained by tannins. It is juicy, the wood a mist in the bright fruit flavors. There is some aging potential, maybe 4–5 years.",33.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"There is good density here, with impressive tannins and very dry core of structure. The wine has weight, with cranberry and red berry flavors shining through. Always, the freshness is right up front.",25.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Big, rounded wine that brings together ripe fruits and taut tannins. It is solid, chunky, spiced and balanced. Black fruits finish an impressive wine for the vintage.",40.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"To judge by this fresh, crisply fruity example, 2006 is a great year for rosé on the Loire. It has lively raspberry flavors and a great burst of finishing acidity. Delicious.",12.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"Initially quite rustic in character, this wine does open up to give the typical pencil shavings aromas of the Cabernet Franc and sweet, perfumed tannins. A fresh wine, with good black currant flavors.",10.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"Owned by Bollinger Champagne, Langlois-Château is one of the top sparkling wine producers in the Loire. But they also make some attractive still wines. This Chinon, soft, fresh and vibrant with red fruits, is a great quaffing wine, simple, with a delicious smoky aftertaste. Drink now.",19.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc

"Light pink in color, this wine has attractive delicate, fresh raspberries, caramel and a touch of spice. Good acidity gives it a great lift. There's a definite southern spice and sunshine to this wine.",11.00,Rhône_Valley,Rosé
"A perennial Best Buy, the Les Jamelles Cinsault is a reliable choice for summer quaffing. It's a little fuller than many rosés, but also a touch more complex, adding hints of minerality to the bold, fruity notes of cherries and watermelon.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Cinsault
"This bright, vibrant pink wine ably combines ample fruit with cool, minerally notes to make a complex, tongue-tingling whole. Wet stone aromas accent cherry-berry flavors, and although the wine is round, there's a hint of CO2 to help provide freshness on the finish.",22.00,Rhône_Valley,Rosé
"There's no new oak used for this wine, but the wine still shows a slightly smoky tinge to its aromas, while the flavors of honey, almond and tangerine are bold and expansive. Finishes long, with a minerally edge.",65.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend

"A wine that emphasizes the fruity character of the year, putting aside any missing tannins. Wood still dominates the fruit, giving spice and bitter chocolate flavors, but the green edge present in the futures tasting has gone, to give final cranberry and black currant freshness.",25.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A wine that has some richness, with blackberry fruits and a fine balance with wood and fruit tannins. It has good structure, but the fruit also offers pleasure in 2–3 years.",17.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A bit stern and tannic, but this tightly wound mix of black olives and espresso should come around by 2012 or shortly thereafter. It's chewy in texture, but finishes with decent fruit, so give it the benefit of the doubt.",54.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"With its high wood flavors and aromas of mint, this sets out to be a modern, extracted style of wine. But it has the lightness of Margaux in 2007, the Cabernet tannins soft and open. It already has good balance, suggesting it is not for long aging.",42.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A recent discovery, this Chardonnay (yes, Chardonnay) has a striking bouquet of flowers, spices, honey and nuts, then adds a peachy fruit component on the palate. It's medium in weight, with a lush texture and a long finish. A super bargain to drink over the summer months.",10.00,Rhône_Valley,Chardonnay
"Almost as good as the '07, Guigal pared down the production of this wine by one-third to maintain its quality level. Pear and melon flavors are buttressed by weight and richness while still retaining freshness and a touch of spice on the finish.",14.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"A finely structured wine, the wood well integrated into elegant firm fruit tannins and spice. Red fruit flavors fit well with the dry element, giving a wine with depth of flavor. Worth aging for 2–3 years.",19.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A soft, gentle style of non-vintage Champagne, due perhaps to its relatively high dosage. But the whole wine is well in balance, the white fruits themselves giving a fine, elegant roundness.",49.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"What a delicious wine. It shows the mineral, almost steely character of 1996. Flavors of grapefruit and green apples are pure and intense; a touch of toast wraps it up. Will develop over many years.",184.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Bone dry, this is a stunning wine that shows the aging qualities of the 1996 vintage as well as the intensity of Salon. It is packed with acidity and firm green fruits, leaving a twist of lemon and nuts on the finish.",300.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Gosset packs this prestige cuvée in a traditional skittle bottle. Almost bone dry to taste, this is full of nervous energy, pink grapefruit flavors, crisp acidity and layers of intense almond and toast flavors.",150.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"An attractively perfumed wine, with white flowers, cut grass and thyme. To taste, it is soft, with the delicacy of Chardonnay giving an elegance to the intense green, crisp flavors. This should be a long-lived wine–at least 10 years.",85.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Philipponnat's 1522 cuvée is a reference to the date of the first record of Philipponnat as grape growers in Ay. It's one of their top wines, and shows off the food- friendly, rich style typical of this producer. It's ripe, rounded, full-bodied, and dominated by Pinot Noir giving it great depth of flavor. It's also a wine meant for aging.",85.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A blanc de blancs, vinified in wood (15% new). It is rich, creamy, and still young with citrus and tropical fruits vying for dominance at this early stage. Wait for this wine to develop over the next five years—it will be magnificent.",120.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Gorgeous, delicious fruit, with flavors of crisp apples and lemon zest underlined by an intensity of structure and flavor. There is just great depth to this impressive wine. The only flaw is that it is too young—wait another five years.",99.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"A delicious, welcoming, generous wine that also manages to keep the pure, mineral character of Chardonnay. It has a very direct, linear, steely taste. Great acidity plays a part, as do ripe, fruity flavors and fine balance. This wine should develop well, but it's delicious now.",150.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Dominated by Chardonnay, this wine has great depth of flavor, benefiting from the 13 years-aging on lees before disgorging. It is now a fine, balanced, mature wine, dominated by grilled almond and toast flavors, leaving a pure trail of acidity to finish.",149.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Certainly an apéritif style, this is still a rich Chardonnay, toasty, developed, with white flower aromas and honey and citrus flavors, that hint at tropical fruits. This is a beautifully balanced wine, flowing through its development towards maturity, but still with good aging potential.",206.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"This is a full-blown, opulent, decadent wine that is packed with wonderful strawberry and ripe fruit flavors. It's at its peak now; it's a generous, delicious glass of wine that overflows with ripe flavors.",300.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This special cuvée is named after the cellar workers whose job was to watch over casks of the best wines. Like other Henriot wines, this is dry, rich and toasty; it's fresh and citrusy on the finish.",149.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"One of the few houses still to ferment in wood (Krug is another), Alfred Gratien cultivates an intense style of wine, which has toasty, buttery characters as well as richness. From 1997, this wine is lighter than other Alfred Gratien vintages, showing more acidity than richness, but there is still a stylistic similarity there.",95.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This Deutz prestige cuvée has a blend of red and white grapes (as contrasted with the blanc de blancs Amour de Deutz). It is beautifully balanced, the superripe Chardonnay giving richness to the structured red grapes. Great with spicy foods, this is a wine that has developed relatively quickly and is ready to drink now.",184.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Better known for its blends dominated by Pinot Noir, Roederer is following the fashion for blanc de blancs in this very dry, but ripely toasty, full-bodied Chardonnay. It has superrich fruit, but still keeps a sense of proportion in its acidity and green plum flavors.",74.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Very dry on the palate, this is nevertheless a rich, full-bodied wine, from a parcel of old vines. The flavors are still young, but show the promise of intense fruitiness, white fruits, and currants. Just a touch of toastiness reveals the fact the wine was aged in barrels before blending.",37.00,Champagne,Pinot_Noir
"A tour de force from this cooperative, whose vines are concentrated in the grand cru vineyards of Mailly. This is a big, bold wine, dominated by Pinot Noir, but with layers of creamy Chardonnay showing through. This is still young, and will certainly age.",89.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A wine that has richness, with acidity, layers of spice and black currant fruit flavors. The dominant cassis gives elegance, and already a forward balance of fruit and wood.",70.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A ripe wine, the wood a band of flavor through the sweet tannins and attractive fresh fruits. It has the lightness of the year, leaving the flavors coming from the bright fruits.",40.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"There is a good core of tannin here, the fruit sweet plums and ripe tannins, relatively soft and easy. Only that kernel of tannin offers some aging possibility.",60.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A wine that has freshness, some wood and a soft series of tannins, almost velvet. There is a stalky juiciness here, to complete a wine that offers the freshest acidity, with only hints of darker fruits.",50.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Almost half of this wine's production of 1,800 cases came to the U.S., which should make this broad, mouthfilling white relatively easy to find. The largely neutral palate suggests pineapple, honey and cinnamon, with citrus and spice lingering on the finish. Drink now.",70.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"With its dry, tight texture, this is an austere wine. The fruit is full of piercing black currant acidity, structured with firm tannins. Smoky wood does give an extra dimension, but the wine needs several months more in bottle.",32.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A concentrated wine, relying on its generous black currant juice fruit rather than the more reticent tannins. The wine is dominated by Cabernet juiciness, a burst of fruit in the glass.",42.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This is a concentrated, balanced, sweetly juicy wine, benefiting from wood and ripe black fig and plum flavors. It has fine ripe tannins that support the freshly juicy fruits. Ready to drink, but will age over 2–3 years.",22.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Rich and round, this is a smooth, creamy wine, its fresh peach fruit flavors touched by lime acidity and sweet apples. There is an attractive light perfume from the Muscadelle in the blend.",14.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Structured and firm, with tannins and some element of wood. There is sweetness here, flavors of licorice, blackberry juice and lively sweetness. The whole wine is dominated by delicious berry fruits.",45.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"With smoky aromas, sweet fruit and soft tannins, this is a wine that is developing well, but quickly. It offers juicy black berry fruits, rounded texture and bright finishing acidity.",45.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The $70 price tag is silly, but the wine itself is very good, combining soft tannins with ample cherry fruit and layers of dried spices. It's full and round in the mouth, long, warm and comforting on the finish. Drink now-2015.",70.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"With this vintage, disgorged in June 2007, there is still great youth. But the fine raspberry and other red fruit flavors make this a well-balanced Champagne, leaning on fruit at this stage, but also showing structure.",57.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Always an enjoyable non-vintage, Heidsieck Monopole's style has changed little despite all the changes in ownership. It has a soft, open character, but never seems sweet, and is more rounded with creamy apple flavors and well-integrated acidity.",40.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is a blend of Pinots and Chardonnay. It is very open and reflective of the vintage; it's a generous wine that improves with air. Green plum flavors give the wine ripe fruit, while the acidity wells up to finish.",80.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"The aromas are almost honeyed, the palate is poised, elegant, crisply green. Despite its youth, this blanc de blancs shows delicious white fruit and crisp green flavors. Great as an apéritif, as it develops and ages, it should also be a good food wine.",55.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"This top wine from Pannier is beautifully crafted and balanced, a credit to the cooperative. It has intense flavors of grapefruit, livened with lemon zest and fresh, crisp acidity. But there is also a weight to it, and a layer of acidity that suggests good aging potential.",77.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This bottle was disgorged in July 1995, allowing nine years of aging. It is a very ripe, soft wine, delicate but still underlain with some of the steely, mineral character of the 1996 vintage. Delicious now, but it will certainly age over the next five years.",66.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"From a 3.75-acre parcel of this grand cru, this is stunning red Burgundy, amazingly complex, lushly fruited and—yes—ageworthy. Plum and black cherry flavors lead the way, but they're joined by notes of meat, earth, wild game, mushroom and saddle leather. Full and lush in the mouth, this is richly tannic but not hard, as some vintages have been in the past.",123.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"From a 6-acre parcel of grand cru vines, this blanc de blancs is still very young. Its pink grapefruit and mineral characters accent a core of lively acidity. It needs time, another five years at least, but is already an impressive wine.",69.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"From the ripe, open 1995 vintage, this is a round wine with flavors of lemons, grapefruits and almonds. The angles of acidity have been turned into curves as it develops and softens. This is ready to drink now, but should age well over 5–10 years.",225.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Creamy, fruity aromas already suggest a light, frothy wine. And that's just what this is, fulfilling all the specifications for a rosé. There's some of the 2000 vintage's acidity, and the wine floats across the mouth.",200.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A superbly ripe Champagne that has all the open generosity of the 1998 vintage. Peach and apricot aromas are followed by flavors of hazelnuts, honey and spices. Of course, it is still very young, and, like all vintages of La Grande Dame, it will age for many years.",120.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Starts off scents with toasted hazelnut that give it an almost white Burgundy-like bouquet, then adds crisp, linear notes of citrus. Firmly structured and fresh, this is worth holding a few years to see how it develops.",39.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"Like most Tardieu Laurent wines, this is lushly textured stuff. Honey and peach notes mingle easily on the nose and in the mouth, fading out just a little too quickly on the finish. Drink now.",59.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"Filled to the brim with bold upfront fruit--peaches and pears tinged with honey and truffle--the chief possible complaint is a certain lack of subtlety (who really needs it?). Fades a little quickly on the finish, but still represents good value. Drink now.",19.00,Rhône_Valley,Roussanne-Viognier
"Wood dominates this wine, the wine itself relatively light, but finely composed. There are spicy tannins with intense acidity, crisp black currants, bursting through the overlay of wood.",80.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Siaurac, at 153 acres, is the largest estate in Lalande de Pomerol. The 2007 shows the relative lightness of the vintage, but boosts it up with chocolate and dark plum flavors. The wine finishes freshly, but still with tight tannins.",31.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This nicely made Crozes features plenty of heft, but also a sense of focus and freshness that gives it immediate appeal. Hints of honey and truffle add complexity to the citrus and melon flavors of this Marsanne-based effort. Drink now-2012.",31.00,Rhône_Valley,Marsanne
"The Caudalies vintage comes from old vines—at least 50 years old. This 1999 is creamy, rich, very soft. It has apricots, ripe fruits, very open, generous and deliciously ready to drink.",120.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Like all the Gimonnet wines, this is very dry, relying for its richness on the ripe Chardonnay (much of it grand cru from Cramant). This is crisp and clean, with pink grapefruit flavors that give it a lift and liveliness, and a fresh green aftertaste.",55.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"A dry, serious wine, but with a delicious poise and elegance to it. Flavors hint at green apples; it glides in to the mouth, just giving a shape from its acidity.",70.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Beautiful pale onion skin color, with a light aroma of strawberries. These simple initial attributes mask a much more complex wine. The fruit flavors are blended in with toast, with some wood and fresh, lifting acidity. A serious rosé.",74.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A powerful, intense wine. The fruit is green and crisp, but the wine is full-bodied, with flavors of toast and almonds over ripe grapefruit and gooseberries. This wine is still very young, only just beginning to integrate the fruit and the acidity—give it 10 years.",65.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Named after a parcel of vines, this superripe wine is made exclusively of Pinot Meunier—it's rare to taste a wine entirely from this grape. Besides being full-bodied, it is also very minerally in character, it has a steely quality which suggests the ability to age well. Applause to Dehours for indicating the disgorgement date on the back label.",42.00,Champagne,Pinot_Meunier
"Flavors of ripe, crisp apples, white fruits and cinnamon dominate this long-lasting, concentrated wine. There is a touch of toastiness in the aroma, but it is still young, with a firm, mineral character to finish.",78.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This blanc de blancs from biodynamic grower Pierre Larmandier  is bone dry, packed with delicious white fruit flavors, very crisp, but also full and rich. There is a great mineral edge to it, which shows how well it will age, but enjoy it now as well.",70.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"This is certainly Chardonnay, full of green apple and white fruit creaminess that is still suspended in acidity and needs time to soften and open. Lovely flavors of spiced pears give the wine a great future.",70.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Moët's style, with its delicious forward fruit, is well evidenced in this 1999 vintage. It is full bodied, with apple and almond flavors, developing a toasty character, but still retaining a ripe, open freshness.",52.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A fresh, lively Champagne, quite soft with crisp white pears and a light sweetness which integrates well with the fruit. Young, without complexity, a good apéritif Champagne.",37.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A dash of Viognier in the blend gives aromatic lift to this Côtes du Rhône, which tastes like honeyed peaches over sun-warmed stones. It's full and broad without being overblown, but seems to be teetering on the edge, with signs of age starting to creep in. Drink up.",13.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"While it is not a powerful wine, it is elegant, balanced, with density of flavor and tannns, freshened by fruit acidity and red cherry and black currant fruits. Like many wines from 2007, this is for the medium term, and can even be drunk now.",30.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Situated on the plateau of Saint-Emilion, just east of the city, Château le Prieuré has produced a finely structured 2007, not big, but well balanced. Touches of cocoa and cinnamon spice cap the solid fruit and dry tannins. Age for 3–4 years.",42.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The continuing improvement at classed growth Camensac under the ownership of the Merlaut family (Chasse-Spleen, Citran, etc) is apparent even in the lesser vintage of 2007. The structure hangs well with the stalky but solid black berry fruit, the acidity a pure streak through it. Age over 4–5 years.",25.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"There is lovely richness here, with fresh acidity and red berry fruit flavors. The texture is round, lightly chewy, with some wood and final stalky fruit.",46.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A spicy, fruity wine, the structure relatively light but firmly dry, with a strong seasoning of black currant fruits. It is fresh, the fruit juicy and vibrant, with an edge of firm wood.",35.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Good density here, with tannins that spring from bright berry fruits. The acidity is certainly present, but it has weight behind it, giving potential richness balanced by wood.",17.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Shows some slightly rustic but authentically Rhônish qualities, ranging from grilled cherries to hints of leather and cured meats. The tannins are supple, turning elegant on the finish. Drink now-2015.",42.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Very airy, light and floating, this is a typical fresh, elegant wine in the Taittinger style. It has delicious, open raspberry and citrusy flavors, with a great finishing pizzazz of freshness.",210.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"While the Amour de Deutz, the other blanc de blancs from Deutz is very much in the apéritif style, this blanc de blancs is more of a food wine. It has structure, lemon zest, peaches and other white fruits and a touch of honey. Already somewhat evolved, but still fresh.",94.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"This is the first vintage of a cuvée named, so the advertising has it, after a figure who is both romantic and modern. It is certainly a fine blend that shows ripe fruit, some layers of toast to go with some honey and fresh white fruits. It should age, but, as an apéritif wine, it's ready to drink now.",65.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is a delicate style of wine, very classic Pommery. But it does have delicious, crisp fruit, apples and cream flavors. It is still young, very fresh and green—needs more time in the bottle.",180.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Unusual in the Philipponnat range (normally dominated by Pinot Noir), this blanc de blancs is a blend of Chardonnays from the Côte des Blancs and from the Montagne de Reims. It is lightly toasty, dry and fresh with a creamy texture and white fruit flavors. It's ready to drink, very light, poised and crisp.",65.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"The creamy aromas, (like baked cookie), make this wine instantly enticing. It is the same on the palate. It is a soft, approachable wine, with creamy richness, a touch of toast, flavors of walnuts and well-integrated acidity.",60.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Putting aside the chic lipstick pink bottle (and the pink plastic box it comes in), this is a pleasing, soft wine, with white fruit flavors which lend crisp point to the easy palate. It is certainly dry, but it is also relatively soft, a well thought out blend.",50.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"In a young, fresh style, this is full of white fruits, crisp acidity and pink grapefruit with a sugar touch. The aftertaste, though, is relatively soft, but still in balance with the rest of the flavors.",46.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Loaded up with toast and vanilla, as you might expect from Tardieu Laurent, but the wine shows plenty of weight and concentration under the wood, and some underlying pear and melon fruit ultimately finds its way out. It's a rich, succulent mouthful of oak and fruit for near-term drinking.",28.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"Shows off the TL barrel regime, with toasty, mealy notes and hints of vanilla that come close to overwhelming the honeyed pear fruit. Turns fresh and pineapple-y on the finish, so give it another year in the bottle to knit all its pieces together.",30.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"Bright, round wine, with a layer of firm mineral tannins, but more about black berry and plum fruits, jammy acidity and a finishing dry structure. This second wine of Vray Croix de Gay will be ready in 2–3 years.",53.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Relatively lightweight, the wine has soft, stalky tannins and flavors of hedgerow fruits to go with the well-judged layer of smoky wood. It is dry, firm and fresh.",67.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Faury has crafted a wonderfully quaffable Old World Syrah in '05, with scents of violets, cracked pepper and ripe blackberries, modest tannins and a crisp, clean finish. Drink now-2012. Imported by Kermit Lynch Wine Merchant.",28.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"This blend of 40% Clairette, 30% Grenache Blanc, 20% Viognier and 10% Roussanne offers up delicate lemony scents alongside hints of pineapple. It's a medium-bodied white, displaying freshness and finesse in its citrus, pear and melon flavors. Drink it over the next year.",12.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"Shows a briary, toughly tensile quality to its aromas, along with hints of beet and meatiness, while the flavors tend more toward black cherries and crushed stone. Round and full in the mouth, with supple tannins on the finish.",59.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This wine is all about finesse and elegance. Aromas of grapefruit and other citrus fruits are enticing. On the palate, the wine is toasty, with orange marmalade and honey flavors, and fresh acidity.",60.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Charles Heidsieck's rosé has a reputation for aging well—but 1999 seems to be an exception, since it is already mature. It shows some good biscuit and baked-cookie flavors, but still retains its strawberry jam fruits. It is rich, soft and very fruity, with the acidity only showing from the background.",80.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A full-bodied style, dominated by flavors of almonds, which indicate that this is moving from fruity youth to maturity. But there is still plenty of acidity there. Has a few years of life yet, but it is a pleasure to drink now.",65.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A richly soft, creamy wine, dominated by flavors of white currants and chives, this is full-bodied and still young. There is enough ripe acidity and full-flavored fruit to see it develop well over five years.",50.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"On the soft side, this ripe, full wine is typical of the vintage. It has pink grapefruit flavors, lightly touched with fine sugar, alongside a crisp structure that promises 2–3 years aging. The aftertaste is open, balancing acidity and softness.",65.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This barrel-fermented blend of Grenache Blanc, Vermentino and Roussanne features hints of toasted hazelnuts, but also plenty of ripe pear flavors and touches of spice and acacia blossom. The texture is lush, the flavors bold, just fading a bit in intensity on the finish.",15.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"It should be easy to stump your wine-geek buddies with this one. At once honeyed and rich, exotic and tropical, this is a rarity they're unlikely to even know exists. A mere hint of bitterness on the finish of this medium-bodied wine nicely balances the ripe tropical flavors. Drink now.",12.00,Rhône_Valley,Clairette
"Soft, rounded, a wine that is both fresh and open. Red berry fruits are suffused with acidity, giving a light touch. This is a wine for drinking in 2–3 years.",55.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Perfumed with new wood aromas and violets, this is a full-bodied wine, its tannins blending into sweet plum and cranberry juice flavors. The wood is finely judged, giving a rounded feel to the finish, along with the acidity.",25.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A finely made wine, with elegant fruit and tannins, but definitely on the light side. The red berry fruits are soft and juicy, already a pleasure to drink, with only short-term aging.",35.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Soft, juicy and fruity, relatively light in character. The tannins are fresh, supporting black currant and fresh, juicy fruit flavors. It's easy and open, developing well, but quickly.",40.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Importer Bobby Kacher has a seemingly limitless portfolio of bargains from the south of France, and this one boasts an intriguing nose of pear, honey and star anise. It's more focused and crisp than many wines from this region, turning citrusy on the finish. Drink now-2012.",13.00,Rhône_Valley,White_Blend
"A wine that is still young and still developing. It shows great raspberry fruit flavors, as well as black cherries. Has a delicate mineral character; this is going to be a fine, mature wine. For now, it is just delicious.",77.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Pascal and Laure Doquet produce Chardonnay-dominated wines. This 1997 premier cru has 25% Pinot Noir in the blend, giving a rich, cookie-and-toast character just beginning to show through the fresh, green fruits. It is finely balanced, very pure.",63.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A blend of 60% Pinot Noir, 30% Chardonnay and 10% Pinot Meunier, this is a light, fresh wine, well developed already, with ripe fruit from a classic Champagne year. The acidity is already moving toward toastiness.",72.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A ripe, soft wine, one that's creamy on the palate. There is just a touch of caramel, but the main flavors are of crystallized lemons, pears and honey. This is delicious, fresh, and a great aperitif wine.",74.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Full-bodied and rich, with the open, lively fruits typical of 1995-vintage Champagne. It does have plenty of crisp acidity in support of its generous flavors and its long-lasting, soft aftertaste.",60.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A dry, toasty wine that shows maturity now. It has a good structure, though, with hints of red apples and green plums.Ready to drink now; better with food than as an apéritif.",60.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Very opulent, from the ripeness of fruit in 1998, this still seems drier than other Moët vintages. It layers acidity with almost tropical flavors, tempered with a citrus element. The aftertaste is round, soft, and appealing.",52.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A lively, crisp blanc de blancs that comes from Chouilly in the Côtes des Blancs. It is green, flavored with cinnamon, baked apples along with some good, steely fruit.",55.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"This has simple, creamy fruit, with a touch of almonds and soft, ripe, flavors. There's pears and fresh fruit salad on the palate, and some sweetness in the aftertaste.",52.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"An easy, full-bodied nonvintage Champagne, with soft white and tropical fruits, a full dosage and a well-integrated, balanced aftertaste.",30.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Guigal's 2007 Crozes manages to be round and lush in texture yet fresh at the same time, melding apple, pear and melon fruit with crisper, citrusy notes that come into focus on the long finish. Drink now-2012.",22.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"It's said that Viognier is difficult to grow, but then how can bargains such as this continue to exist? For $10, you get truffled pear aromas rounded out by the addition of melon, decent concentration and a long, dusty-minerally finish. Drink now.",10.00,Rhône_Valley,Viognier
"This reliable Luberon producer has quietly turned out another good value. An understated, medium-bodied white from the Luberon, this Roussanne offers modest pear elements intertwined with attractive musky-spicy notes. Drink it over the next year or so.",13.00,Rhône_Valley,Roussanne
"Fresh and juicy, with bright acidity and some solid tannins. Flavors of spice accompany an edge of green fruit. The aftertaste is tannins and wood.",200.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A soft wine, with tannins over easy, fresh fruits. The structure is light, rounded with flavors of rhubarb, black currant and red cherries to give freshness. Not a wine for aging.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Very toasty wood aromas, the wine itself packed with new wood, fresh spice, the fruit lost somewhere at this stage. But it does have some weight and underlying hints of concentration.",42.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A blend of 80% Grenache Blanc and 20% Bourboulenc, this Sensation makes a bold impact, offering assertive notes of peach and pineapple that verge on the tropical. (Is that banana and mango as well?) It's plump but not heavy, with a clean, fresh finish. Drink over the next 6-12 months.",12.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"A full-bodied, ripe wine with some honey and baked-apple flavors. This is straightforward and well-balanced, with tastes of croissants, green plums, and finishing with fresh acidity.",41.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Salmon-pink colors set this scintillating wine off to a good start. This is round, soft, with seductive, rich raspberry flavors that float off the tongue. It is a great apéritif wine, demanding to be drunk now.",60.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is ripe, open wine with layers of Pinot Noir showing richness and lively acidity. It is soft, with white fruit and a pure, straightforward character. Maturing fast.",85.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"How soft and creamy this is! With its aromas of pears, its generous, open character and its flavors of ripe white fruits, this is what 1998 is all about. Drink now; it's delicious, but it won't age much longer.",52.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"From Pinot Noir, with just a touch of Pinot Meunier, this is a powerful, full-bodied wine, with aromas of dried flowers and flavors of stewed fruits, balanced with honey and fresh, crisp acidity. Weighty; this is definitely a food-friendly Champagne.",56.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Toasty aromas are the first hints that this is now a mature wine. Its layers of acidity mingle with toast, walnuts and rich, mature fruit. Definitely a wine for those who prefer their bubblies with some age.",95.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"If a Faiveley Burgundy could ever be accused of having a slightly New World style, this would be the one. It shows classic Burgundian notes of toasted nuts and a lovely mealy texture, but also great generosity of fruit, ranging from pear and apple to honey and melon. Drink now–2010.",21.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Although the varietal composition isn't typical of Châteauneuf (one-third each Grenache, Syrah, Mourvèdre), the flavors certainly are, combining baked fruit with dusty earth and touches of leather and spice. It's soft and round in the mouth, with a juicy, mouthwatering finish. Drink now-2015.",34.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"While this wine has pleasant fruit, there are also some dark edges of black berries and rough tannins. The focus is shaded, still developing.",30.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A tight, stalky wine, with acidity, fresh black currant buoyed up by the dry taut tannic structure. It is on the light side, almost ready to drink, finishing with a light jamminess.",19.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Dusty tannins gives the wine some weight and richness. Juicy blackberry flavors combine with the fresh acidity of the vintage, but with an extra burst of power. There is a fine, crisply acidic aftertaste.",19.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Made in a fruit-driven style with an undercurrent of stony minerality, this medium-bodied blend of Grenache Blanc and Roussanne hints at pear and citrus. Drink now.",12.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"This single-vineyard blanc de blancs premier cru is, curiously, more mature than the 1997 version of the same wine. It is ripe, open, generous, with perfumed cantaloupe and just a hint of structure. Drink now, it is delicious.",63.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Soft and toasty, this wine is green, fresh and relatively lightweight for a Taittinger Champagne. There are attractive green plum flavors and a fresh, definite acidity to the finish.",65.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A very fresh, crisp style, zinging with acidity and flavors of lemon zest. There is just a touch of toastiness to indicate some maturity, but this is mainly green, light and refreshing.",89.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"High acidity shows both that this is a young wine, and that 2000 is not a particularly ripe vintage. There is some attractive tannic structure here, but this will always be a relatively austere wine.",74.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Piper's style is toasty, soft and lively, and this chimes with the open character of the 1998 vintage. There is certainly acidity and some green fruit flavor, but the softness, ripeness and finishing toasty character are what shows best.",65.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is fresh and lively with great citrus flavors and a firm structure. On the dry side, it shows crispness, apple-skin flavors and a light, poised, elegant character. Will age over the mid term.",66.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"The name means “timeless”, and this wine is a definite apéritif wine, maybe for when time matters little. It is soft but still crisp, layering attractive apple acidity over a creamy texture and a light, fresh aftertaste.",69.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Floral and fresh, this is very much in the light Delamotte style. White fruits dominate the palate. Balanced and poised overall.",74.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"A mature, toasty wine, perhaps too toasty. There are still hints of ripe strawberries as well as the more mature flavors. The wine shows a full-bodied character and an attractive onion skin color.",160.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A lively Champagne, initially all froth and fizz. But get through that and there is a pleasant, slightly sweet wine— perhaps more full-bodied than some. The primary red-fruit flavors have been lessened by some bottle age, leaving a wine which has a hint of maturity.",45.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A soft juicy wine, with mid-weight. The berry fruits, the black currant juice and the fresh acidity are enjoyable. It's developing fast, and not likely to age.",34.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Despite only 15% new oak, this wine comes across as toasty and caramelly, with delicate touches of pear, honey and wet stones. There's plenty of weight and length, so fans of oaked whites will find plenty to like.",52.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"Just like the '07, this is a blend of 60% Grenache Bl;anc, 20% Marsanne and 20% Roussanne, featuring ripe melon and peach fruit wrapped around an underlying minerality. It's full and broad, yet manages to be refreshing despite its weightiness.",12.00,Rhône_Valley,White_Blend
"As sometimes with Angludet, there is a rusticity to the tannins that brings down the fruit. The freshness, though, is there, an attractive bright berry character, spiced with cinnamon.",28.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Opens with fine aromas of pear and crushed stone, then adds tiny touches of anise and honey on the palate. This is broad on the midpalate, but retains focus on the finish, where it turns crisp and rather hard edged. Drink now.",31.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"This is a ripe, soft wine that still tastes young and fresh. The palate is smooth, with a fine citrus zing on the clean finish. Drink now, or keep for two to three years. Available in 2007.",45.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"The special cuvée of Boizel, first made in 1961, is a Pinot Noir-dominant wine, giving an extra richness to the smooth, creamy, lightly toasty flavors. It is powerful and rich, but with a touch of softness that leaves a flavor of orange peel in the mouth.",140.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Honey and white fruit aromas are followed by a soft, easy wine that has creaminess, pear flavors and fresh acidity. It is rich, gentle and at its peak of maturity.",85.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Intended as a vintage to be drunk young, this is a skilful blend of different fresh, relatively light Chardonnays. It is crisp, a great apéritif wine, although with its particularly tiny bubbles, it is also good as a food wine.",50.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Notes of toast and smoky quartz show on the nose, then add pear and apple flavors on the palate. From a Faiveley monopole in Mercurey, this shows a fair amount of minerality on the finish and a plump palate presence. Drink now and over the next few years.",24.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"No, not the goddess: Venus is the name of the horse that plows the Agrapart vineyards. This wine, labeled “nature”—without dosage—is all green apples and very dry. It's distinctive, but many would find it too distinctive because of its rather lean edge, and very acidic aftertaste.",93.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Very soft, gentle Champagne, showing definite signs of a sweet dosage, with its flavors of brown sugar, baked apples and light acidity. It is full-bodied, which keeps the wine together, but it is too rich.",24.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A soft, very open, lightweight wine, that has some richness along with its white fruits. It tastes sweet, from what appears to be a relatively high dosage.",140.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Very soft and open, this wine seems to be all froth and apples-and-cream flavors. It has a light touch of acidity, which comes through as the froth subsides.",49.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is soft, with ripe peach flavors and some toasty acidity. It's an easy style, perfumed and ready to drink.",120.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A soft, ripe, creamy wine that works because of its fine balance between soft fruit flavors and a line of acidity. There is some intensity of flavor from the old-vine fruits. Enjoy over the next two or three years.",65.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"A delicious apéritif style of Champagne, with nutty aromas, crisp, creamy fruit, and a delicate aftertaste. It should age attractively, over the next five years.",79.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"White fruits, almonds and soft, crisp acidity are the hallmarks of this lightweight, fresh wine.",44.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Considerable bottle aging shows with the nutty, toasty flavors of this wine. The fruit has gone, leaving structured maturity, somewhat austere, but a definite appeal to those who like older Champagne.",50.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A full, somewhat sweet wine, fresh with foamy strawberries in the mouth. The acidity is missing somewhere, but this does make for a pleasing wine, certainly a fine partner to fresh fruits.",47.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"With vineyards in the Côte des Bar, in the south of Champagne, the Moutard-Diligent family can trace its origins in the region back to the 17th century. This is a soft wine, a blanc de blancs (although only the back label indicates this). It is very ripe and creamy, benefiting from the warm conditions of the 1999 harvest, and just showing a touch of acidity to finish.",50.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"This still white wine from the Champagne region is produced from one parcel of old Chardonnay vines. With spicy wood aromas, and dominant wood flavors, the actual taste of the fruit is hard to discern. There's intense acidity. A curiosity, and a reminder that Champagne is better sparkling.",80.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"A fresh, light Champagne, that explodes with liveliness in the mouth. It is crisp, easy, but also has the green flavors that seem typical of the 2000 vintage.",69.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A very soft wine, dominated by a creamy character and fresh acidity. Very lively, very light, great as an apéritif.",60.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Crisp and fresh, this is a light wine, dominated by acidity and slightly unripe grapefruit flavors. It's pleasant, if too acidic, but could soften with age. Keep a couple of years and try again.",52.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Here's a real Champagne curiosity, wine made from six grape varieties. Apart from the usual three (Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier), there are Pinot Blanc, Petite Meslier and Arbanne, a variety that is almost extinct. All are permitted under Champagne rules. The Arbanne gives a very floral character to the wine, which is attractive and unlike any Champagne you will ever drink. With such ripeness, it tastes like it came from Carneros, rather than Champagne.",48.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A ripe, easy soft style that allows some acidity to give the wine backbone. It is well integrated, ready to drink now, and is a rare example from one of the worst vintages on record.",45.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This mature, toasty wine is made by the Secondé family, grandchildren of Edmond Barnaut. It is developing attractive, roasted almond and very ripe flavors. Drink now.",58.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"The Thau lake is in Herault, near Montpellier, where Hecht & Bannier also have their winery. They have made a fresh, candy explosion of a rosé, with just a touch of sweetness and open fruit.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
"Apple and ripe fruit flavors show the quality of the 2005 vintage. This wine, easy and gentle, has some depth of flavor and firm, young acidity at this stage. Imported by Palm Bay Imports.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Made in a sweet, broad style, this Chablis company's venture into the Loire has yielded a soft, mouthfilling wine with aromas of wet wool and mineral backed by flavors of pear and melon.",12.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"A medium-bodied to full Gewürz, with floral aromas that carry attractive lychee notes. But bubble gum flavors seem slightly confected on the palate, and the wine finishes short.",27.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"Crisp and light, with flavors of fresh cantaloupe and lychees. The aftertaste is soft, and just slightly sweet. Imported by Palm Bay Imports.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Boasts assertive strawberry and lime aromas, but drops off a bit on the palate, courtesy of relatively low acidity.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé
"Sweet and a bit low in acidity, this Vouvray features thick, pear-flavored fruit and a short finish. Serve well chilled.",13.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"A very soft wine, flavored with nutmeg and baked apples. It is unfocused, and the acidity seems to come in from a strange angle, leaving a wine that is easy to drink, but not quite together.",49.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Plump and honeyed, this is a solid offering from a region in which Faiveley can't fall back on its vineyards. Pear, apple and honey flavors finish soft, with gentle chalky nuances. Drink now.",15.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Smells and tastes a bit confected, with lime sherbet aromas vying with hints of spring flowers and talcum powder, turning a little sweet and flabby in the mouth.",19.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Doesn't smell bad, showing off bright citrus and herbal notes, but turns heavy and candied on the palate, ending with cotton candy and bubble gum flavors.",12.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé
"Diamant Bleu used to be a brand name of Heidsieck Monopole, now transferred to the Vranken range when Vranken acquired Heidsieck. It's a rather hard wine, with edges of acidity and showing sharp grapefruit flavors.",125.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A very soft, creamy wine that seems to miss the fruit flavors, but still delivers an attractive if somewhat unfocused taste. Drink now.",135.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"With its aromas of fresh hay, this is strangely mature for such a young wine. It seems to already have reached the toast and butter stage, leaving most of its fresh fruit behind. It's drinkable, but won't keep.",100.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Shows some rustic spicy and herbal notes, along with strawberry and herbal tea flavors. Light in body, and a bit tart and tannic on the finish, this lacks the generosity shown by the other 2004 reds in the lineup.",21.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Full and sweet on the bouquet, with bits of chalk dust, wax bean and bread. Round and ripe, like every 2003 we came across. The flavors go toward peach and pear, with hints of balancing lime and mineral. Melony and long on the finish, with a spot of alcoholic warmth. Imported by Louis Latour.",34.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Sharp and smoky at first, but cleaner and more open if given time. Light apple and peach flavors mix with citrus, while the finish is simple, clean and touched by white pepper. This one sports just enough power and heft to handle the acidity, which is sharp. Imported by Frederick Wildman and Sons, Ltd.",26.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Quite fruity, with tropical aromas of pineapple and citrus. Not much mineral or flint, but plenty of soft fruit like pink grapefruit, peach and melon. A round, warming wine that may not have a ton of verve; yet another softie from 2003. Imported by Michael Skurnik Wines.",20.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"With its simple, earthy fruit, this is an easy- drinking wine, which is certainly ready now. The citric flavors make it refreshing, but it does not have —nor should it have—complexity. Imported by Frederick Wildman and Sons, Ltd.",20.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Made in a relatively soft, friendly style, this wine starts off floral and citrusy, then turns honeyed and apple-y in the mouth. Plump and low acid, it's an easy introduction to Alsace's Riesling. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",16.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Bready and round, and super attractive on the bouquet. Runs a bit crisp in the mouth, with orange and grapefruit flavors. But just when you see it as racy, there's an open creaminess that softens the palate. Full and long on the finish, with complexity. Imported by Maisons Marques & Domaines USA.",180.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A fresh style of late harvest Riesling, which favors currants, almonds and fruit salad flavors. It is poised and elegant, giving ripeness but not overt sweetness. There is fine acidity to finish.",18.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Ripe and sun-baked, with heavy aromas of honey, white flowers and pink grapefruit. Itï¿½s the antithesis of a lean, wispy wine in that it pushes substantial melon, citrus and peppery flavors. Finishes short and plump. Imported by Kobrand.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Richly colored in hues of amber and gold, with a toasty, full-bodied nose that offers maturity and depth. This Champagne is totally on the money, with ripe but reserved apple and citrus flavors, and then the slightest bit of mushroom and baked bread on the finish. Imported by Palm Bay Imports.",60.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Smooth and open up front, with peach, melon and orange peel flavors. Admirable depth and solidity throughout, with a likable feel and consistency from front to back. Crisp and lively; would be perfect with appetizers. Imported by Vranken America.",39.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Organic, with clean, solid, forward aromas that blend in ginger and dust. The opening flavors are of orange and tangerine, while the second layer deals yeast and other drier elements. Great feel and balance, with zest throughout as well as touches of vanilla. Imported by Organic Vintners.",60.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Overt and round, with chunky aromas of berries and stone fruits. Quite lively and zesty, with purity of flavors. Is it a touch limited in scope and complexity? Yes. But the nectarine and orange flavors are crystalline and the mouthfeel rocks. Imported by Vranken America.",130.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Mature, with a touch of scrambled egg and burnt sulfur on the dry bouquet. This one runs lean and crisp, with green apple and a hint of lemon on the palate. That said, there's still laudable depth of flavor and complexity. Overall the impression is largely of citrus. Imported by Laurent-Perrier.",90.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Ripe and round, with aromas of almond, talcum powder and plenty of melon and citrus. Quite standard but good, with full, attractive flavors of melon, orange and custard. Not too racy, like almost every 2003 Sancerre we tried. Imported by Louis Dressner Selections.",20.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Smoky and full on the nose, with shots of aromatized body oil, peach, honey and dried spice. Round and warm to taste, with flavors of peach, melon and fresh butter. Finishes with some barrel influence and minerally citrus notes. Stylish enough. Imported by Metrowine Distribution.",20.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Fairly heavy and floral, with buttery, sweet aromas. That same bouquet weight carries onto the palate, where the ripe green melon and spiced-fruit flavors are meaty and broad. Finishes warm and chunky. Imported by North Berkeley Imports.",28.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Gold in color, with round, honeyed aromas of peach and mango. Not steely at all; in fact, it's all about ripe fruit, softness and sun-drenched apricot and other stone-fruit flavors. Not a ton of depth behind the curtain, but weighty and warm throughout. Imported by Kobrand.",35.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Nice apple, vanilla and mineral on the nose, but flavorwise, the wine comes up reserved and simple. There's some citrus, pear and pineapple along with mineral and chalk, but it doesn't sing and it surely isn't intense. Lightweight; a nice quaff. Imported by Daniel Johnnes Wines.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Soft, verging on flabby, with decent honey and pear flavors that finish without much lift or vibrancy. Good, but nothing more. Imported by Maisons Marques & Domaines USA.",28.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"Rounder and fuller than in previous years. The color is a bit gold and the nose offers aromas of lemon and peach touched up by some toast. Plump on the palate, with bergamot, melon and peach flavors. Finishes with almondy, minerally notes. Imported by Michael Skurnik Wines.",23.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Much disagreement in our assessment of this wine. Our threesome of judges agreed on the green, almost salad-like aromas of the stripped-back nose. But on the palate we split. Two of the three panelists didnï¿½t object to the bracing acidity and sharp citrus flavors, with one calling it ï¿½backbone.ï¿½ Imported by Robert Kacher Imports.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Citrus rind and pickle aromas raise your eyebrows, but below the surface it runs rather smoothly. Basic green melon and peach flavors are round but not that rich, while the finish is broad and mostly satisfying. Imported by Michael Skurnik Wines.",23.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Dry and spicy, with aromatic notes of spiced ham and dried fruit. Berry and peach flavors are solid and fresh, and there's just enough broadness on the finish. Shows a modicum of complexity on a forward, easy foundation. Imported by Vranken America.",47.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Ripe and forward, with a bit of sweetness in the form of root beer and nutmeg. The palate is equally ripe, as it shows melon and red-apple flavors. Long on the back end, with a blend of cinnamon and vanilla. Fairly simple but classy. Imported by Moët Hennessy USA.",65.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Apple and pine aromas are the highlights of the simple bouquet, while the mouth is big, heavy and weighted down by sweet fruit, particularly peach and mango. Seems a bit heavy and lacking in verve for a Loire Sauvignon, but that's 2003 for you. Imported by Daniel Johnnes Wines.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Like a textbook Loire white, it's minerally and crisp, with aromas of stone fruits, citrus and pink grapefruit. Not the deepest wine going, but what's here is solid. Look for stony flavors of grapefruit and orange, with a short, simple finish. Imported by House of Burgundy.",20.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Grassy up front, with grapefruit, sour apple and sucking-candy aromas. Very simple, with peach and melon flavors. Not harsh in any way, but innocuous and soft. Imported by Frederick Wildman and Sons, Ltd.",30.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Middle of the road white wine, with a nose dictated by pink grapefruit, peach and pear. Not the most exciting painting in the museum, but nothing wrong either. Good but sort of flat.",10.00,Bordeaux,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Exceedingly pungent, with piercing aromas of cat pee and prickly pear cactus. Comes across a touch acidic and lean, with flavors of dry tangerine peel and green apple. Yet with all that noted it still seems pulpy and fat on the palate. Not bad but not great. Imported by Frederick Wildman and Sons, Ltd.",20.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Gritty and sweaty to start, although it finds a better groove with time. Shows basic citrus and herb on the palate, followed by lemon. Seems a bit salty on the finish. Imported by World Shippers & Importers Co.",21.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Flinty and lean, with mineral and citrus aromas. An “oyster wine” in that it's ultra tart. Flavors of sour apple, lemon and pineapple will show best if it's served chilled. And remember those oysters; this one needs them as much as the other way around. Imported by Maisons Marques & Domaines USA.",32.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A lot of vanilla and cotton candy on the nose, and that's backed by sweet melon and strawberry flavors. Sweetness is a recurring theme, and although it's lively and has good mouthfeel, it's not as dry as we'd like. Best if you prefer a sweet-dosage style. Imported by Palm Bay Imports.",70.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Ultra flinty and tight, with crisp, almost lean lemon and pineapple flavors. This is one tight ball of citrus, and it doesn't have a whole lot of texture to it. Probably best with shellfish. Imported by Maisons Marques & Domaines USA.",39.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A total barrel buster with a heavily roasted nose along with waxy, slightly horsey aromas. Fails to excite on the palate; there's mostly baked fruit and pepper. Big and heavy on the finish. Imported by Kobrand.",21.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"This mass-market Sancerre offers nothing but tart citrus and acid. Lean on the palate but clean, with more than enough orange and lemon. A one-noter. Imported by Maisons Marques & Domaines USA.",30.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Some tropical fruit on the nose, but also sulfur and a distracting tarry note. Rubbery and artificial tasting, with a short peach-pit finish. Seems faux in the way it comes across. Imported by International Gourmet.",26.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Gold in color with aromatic intensity. Trouble is, the wine is heavy and dull. Simply put, the watery melon and citrus flavors just don't cut it as far as high-end Loire whites go. Imported by Frederick Wildman and Sons, Ltd.",32.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A lovely, fruit-filled rosé, yet one that manages to tie in notes of mineral and spice to complement cherry pie and peach flavors. Medium-bodied, with a long, complex finish.",16.00,Rhône_Valley,Rosé
"A fresh, but full-bodied wine, which has aromas of citrus and sawn wood. It is ripe, smooth, with vanilla layers sandwiched between green fruits and white currants. This makes an attractive food wine for fish and white meat dishes.",9.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Candied aromas call to mind confectioners' sugar, tart strawberries and bubble gum. Light and frothy in the mouth, picking up chalky, orangey notes on the finish.",33.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Fruity and simple, with green apple and citrus aromas and flavors that are direct and satisfying, even if they're not particularly nuanced. Medium-weight; picks up some herbal notes on the finish.",11.00,France_Other,Chardonnay
"From the Boisset-owned Château la Croix Martelle, this Pinot Noir is something of a rarity for Languedoc. It is firm with dense wood tannins which cover the varietal character. The end is a fine, well-made wine which seems to have little varietal character.",24.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Pinot_Noir
"This unoaked Chardonnay has some sligtly nutty qualities on the nose, allied to a bit of peach. It's unabashedly ripe, a bit heavy and alcholic, but at least it offers more texture than your typical Pays d'Oc Chard. Pear and spice flavors round out the package.",8.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"Toasty and yeasty on the nose, and with a pale color and fine bead, at first glance this looks very promising. And truth be told, it is pretty good, just not as good as we'd want it to be. the flavors are nice, offering more toasty elements and a bit of anise, but the mouthfeel is heavy and lacks balancing crispness.",20.00,Alsace,Champagne_Blend
"Fresh creamy fruit gives this wine immediate appeal. It has tropical flavors, a light touch of green and fresh, crisp acidity. Great summer drinking.",8.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A decent quaffing rosé, with a bright strawberry hue and aromas and flavors of bubblegum, cherries and red plums. Turns herbal and slightly drying on the finish.",9.00,Provence,Rosé
"This deep-golden sparkler has some pleasantly toasty, faintly eggy aromas, medium body and a relatively large bead. Finishes a little rough.",15.00,Burgundy,Champagne_Blend
"Supple, soft fruit gives this wine a simple easy-drinking character. It's great for apéritifs, rich enough for food and just plain enjoyable.",8.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"Different from many inexpensive Merlots in that it offers a fair amount of acid and tannin structure to go along with plummy, coffee-tinged fruit. Crisp and dry on the finish, giving it the edge to pair successfully with grilled steaks or burgers.",12.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot
"Ripe- and fresh-smelling--peach-like, with overtones of pink grapefruit. Plump and slightly viscous in the mouth, offering pink grapefruit and melon flavors. A bit low in acid, likely a result of the tremendously hot vintage, but still tasty.",8.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Oily and unexpressive, with aromas of wax beans and butterscotch. Underripe nectarine flavors carry the dull palate to an equally boring finish. Tasted twice. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",24.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"An attractive wine with spicy fruitcake flavors. It is simple, easy to drink and well-made. A touch of acidity lends it balance, the dried fruits give it some heat.",8.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot
"A very mature, toasty wine, which has acidity and wonderful toasty flavors. It is rich, but somehow there is a hint of sweetness from the dosage which suggests the wine is reaching the end of its life. Drink now.",90.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is an earthy, perfumed style of wine, full of sweet, juicy fruit and layers of dry tannins. For a basic Côtes du Rhône, this is a full-bodied rich wine.",9.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Soft, light and fresh, this wine has attractive acidity as well as crisp, green flavors. There's a touch of vanilla which broadens it out. It's a solid, ready-to-drink wine.",6.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"Starts off promising, with hints of roasted nuts and grilled peaches, but seems to lose steam as it goes down. Still, the modest peach and pear flavors finish smoothly.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"The young wine from this estate is principally a blend of Syrah and Grenache. Ripe soft fruit, easy to drink and full of black fruits, this is a delicious, early drinking wine.",11.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Red_Blend
"A hint of butteriness, grilled nuts and ripe peaches give this wine a bit of California-esque quality. It's plump and ripe in the mouth, then turns a bit tart and metallic on the finish.",8.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"The bubbles here aren't very plentiful or vigorous, but this wine offers pleasant peach, orange and toast flavors, a soft mousse and a clean, fresh finish. A decent value in bubbly, just don't expect a lot of bubble.",11.00,France_Other,Chardonnay
"Clean and fruity, with pleasant notes of cherry, watermelon and a strawberry. It's medium bodied and makes for a fine late-summer quaff on the patio. By the time this gets into print, you'll probably want to look for the 2003, which should be arriving soon.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé
"Tavel is famous for its rosés, and wines like this are the reason. First, there's the beautiful red rose color. Then the complex, inviting bouquet of cherries, peaches and herbs. Stone fruit flavors are bolstered on the finish by refreshingly cool herb and mineral shadings. A complete package.",15.00,Rhône_Valley,Rosé
"The price is almost ridiculous for the quality. This is a dark, plummy rosé, perhaps best served with beef because of its bold flavors, full-bodied, textured mouthfeel and slightly tannic finish. Next time you're thinking Beaujolais, try this instead.",11.00,Rhône_Valley,Rosé
"A blend of Grenache, Cinsault, Mourvèdre and Carignan, this wine from organically grown grapes boasts aromas of crushed stone and fresh limes that set the mouth watering. It's medium-bodied, not as heavy or rich as some Provence rosés, but complex and refreshing.",13.00,Provence,Rosé
"Quite red in color and a tad unusual. The nose has rhubarb, berry and beet, while the palate is jumpy and tastes like raspberry. Bubbly on the finish. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",175.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"From Dujac's negociant side, this is a light-bodied wine with elegant smoke, beet, ginger and cinnamon aromas. Some cherry and vanilla flavors appear on the palate, ending on a lingering, sinuous note of acidity. Drink now-2010.",38.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This is one of the legendary whites of Bordeaux. It lives up to its reputation. The 2001 vintage of the Domaine de Chevalier white (tasted from half bottle) is well-evolved, packed with flavors of almonds, toast, spice, fresh grapefruits, white fruits and an impressive layer of acidity. It will age for a good 20 years or more. Expect a full bottle to be less evolved at this stage.",100.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"“For me, this vintage is what makes Margaux special,” says Margaux winemaker Paul Pontallier. He is right: With its denseness, spice, flavors of black currants layered with dryness and fresh acidity, this is a huge and impressive wine that never forgets that it is Margaux. It is still young, and the dry tannic aftertaste, which lasts for many minutes, shows this.",300.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This is a great wine, which will age almost indefinitely. What makes this wine so great is its complex mix of intense fresh fruits, flavors of pink grapefruit and subtle wood. But there is also a depth of acidity, which shows how well this wine will age.",100.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Surprisingly lively and fresh, this is still a seriously impressive wine. The high proportion of Semillon is now coming to dominate the Sauvignon, to give a wine that is finely shaped, full of creamy flavors of wood and some white peach. In 10 years, this will still be fresh, in 15 just mature.",240.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"It may have had a few winemaking controversies in recent years, but Giscours is now on a roll, under the ownership of Dutch businessman Eric Albada Jelgersma. How good it is, is shown in the 2001 wine, which is generous, almost opulent, rich and dense. Despite the richness, though, this is still Bordeaux: Dry tannins, tarry black-fruit flavors and firmness place the wine definitely at the table.",40.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This is a well-structured juicy, fruity wine. Aromas of redcurrants, and flavors of fresh black fruits, are balanced by firm, dry tannins and some acidity.",6.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Cabernet_Sauvignon
Soft flavors along with a burst of alcohol make this a powerful wine. It is peppery and full-bodied and not for the faint-hearted.,12.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé
"The Chenin Blanc grape of Vouvray lends itself well to this lightly sweet style of wine (the French call it demi-sec). It is soft, with peach aromas and flavors, the taste of nuts and with good, balancing acidity. It leaves a clean, fresh, soft aftertaste.",9.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Aggressively toasty, with a slightly burnt edge to the aromas, which also include green apple, lime and fern fronds. Seems a bit sweet on the finish.",11.00,France_Other,Sparkling_Blend
"This flagship wine from the Minervois is disappointing. It is lightweight, dominated by acidity. Maybe the vintage did not help, but this is has an undernourished feel to it which demands more in the way of richness.",9.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Red_Blend
"This simple acidic quaff blends grapefruit and gooseberry flavors in a tart, cleansing wine best served as an apéritif.",9.00,Southwest_France,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Fresh and citrusy on the nose, with only the faintest hint of toasty, autolytic character. Lemon and grapefruit flavors come across as slightly coarse and rustic before a burnt note creeps in on the finish.",17.00,Loire_Valley,Sparkling_Blend
"Decently made but modest Chardonnay, with melon flavors that turn tart and earthy, veering toward grapefruit on the finish.",8.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"This is Piper's style of making extra dry wines. Its pale raspberry color suggests a  party wine, but to taste it is more raw than pretty, with high acids and light green flavors. It doesn't hang together, with the fruit struggling to get through the acidity.",45.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A deceptive wine, in that it seems full-bodied but ultimately lacks concentration and depth. Melon and spice flavors support modest floral aromas.",8.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay-Viognier
"This wine in its multi-colored bottle is well-made, soft, easy drinking and fresh. There are soft, light tannins and some good red juicy fruit flavors.",8.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot
"Leathery and meaty, with a slick mouthfeel and notes of overripe blackberries. Supple on the finish.",8.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
"Light to medium in body, this tart, red-fruited wine also carries a bunch of fresh green herbs. Narrowly focused, sour cherry flavors, simple but quaffable.",7.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot
"There is lightweight, fresh fruit, flavors of crisp apples and grapefruit, along with a refreshing touch of acidity. The only downside is that it seems unfocussed in its fruit flavors",6.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A deep purple colored wine, with violet and lavender perfumes. There are firm tannins, and flavors of sweet, black fruits, balanced with acidity. The wine is just spoilt by a touch of leaness to finish.",6.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Shiraz
"Washington D.C.-based importer Bobby Kacher has a veritable stable of bargain-priced rosés, but this one is among the least expensive. Although only a Vin de Pays, it's located in prime south-of-France rosé country, between Avignon and Nîmes. This blend of Merlot (35 percent), Syrah (25 percent), Grenache (20 percent), Mourvèdre, Carignana and Cabernet Sauvignon offers slightly floral scents alongside hints of crushed stone, while the flavors lean toward rose petals and raspberries with a squirt of lime juice. Silky on the finish, with tangy acids for refreshment.",9.00,Rhône_Valley,Rosé
"Cherries and peaches mingle with stonier notes on the nose, then sterner apple, citrus and mineral flavors take hold of the medium-bodied palate. Finishes clean and crisp. A prototypical south-of-France rosé, fairly priced and versatile at the table or as an apéritif.",11.00,Rhône_Valley,Rosé
"A typical blend of Cinsault, Mourvèdre, Grenache and Syrah, this fresh, tangy rosé features hints of cherries and berries layered over peach and canteloupe. White chocolate adds a creamy note to the palate, completing this refreshing wine.",13.00,Provence,Rosé
"This blend of Cinsault, Mourvèdre and Grenache shows plenty of stony minerality and even a suggestion of salinity, but also enough peach and lemon fruit to help balance that out. Creamy in the mouth, it finishes on the full side.",20.00,Provence,Rosé
"A perennial Best Buy, this juicy, fruit-filled rosé offers the ultimate in outdoor consumption, with simple, direct watermelon flavors bold enough to stand up to bbq smoke, pool chlorine and cut grass. The mouthwatering finish is a bonus.",8.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Cinsault
"An interesting wine, one that offers ripe watermelon and strawberry fruit but also intriguing herbal nuances that add complexity. It's on the full-bodied side of things, but creamy textured and not at all heavy, with a refreshing snap to the finish.",16.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé
"Slightly richer in texture than Moutète's regular bottling, but not any better overall. Smells a bit like fresh cantaloupe with hints of peach and raspberry, then adds some chalky notes on the fresh, clean finish.",17.00,Provence,Rosé
"A huge, powerful, dense wine, which layers pure black fruits over dusty tannins. This is an impressive wine, proof of Rauzan-Ségla's improvements since Chanel took over ownership. It is packed with fruits, like an intense jelly, but also has dryness, acidity and good aging potential.",57.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"To call Kirwan a rising star is no longer true, since this property, owned by the Schyler family, and with Michel Rolland as consultant, is now firmly back in its right quality place among classed growths. It is modern in style, as is expected, but the dark, black currant, extracted fruits, new wood and structure don't detract from its elegance.",40.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Nearly always a decent value, this vintage has turned out even better than usual, offering berry and milk chocolate aromas and flavors that are fresh and fruit driven. Nicely textured on the finish, with soft tannins that make it easy to drink.",7.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
"This rosé of Cabernet Franc shows hints of bubble gum and candied cherries on the nose, but settles down on the palate to offer more grownup notes of citrus, herb and mineral. It's light and fresh, finishing with a hint of anise. Best on its own or with seafood. Multiple U.S. importers.",12.00,Loire_Valley,Cabernet_Franc
"This widely available rosé starts a bit slow, taking some time to show its modest aromas and flavors of melon and berry fruit. But then it charms on the finish, where it seems to grow in intensity, ending crisp and refreshing.",8.00,Rhône_Valley,Rosé
"This medium-bodied blend of 40% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 30% Cinsault offers simple, fruity flavors suggestive of peaches, red plums and citrus fruit. Crisp and clean on the finish; a nice picnic rosé.",10.00,Provence,Rosé
"A nice summer rosé, if only it weren't quite so expensive. The color is a pretty light copper hue, the aromas fresh and minerally, with touches of watermelon rind and strawberry. It's fairly full-bodied, with flavors that hint at berries and anise, then finish with a hint of fennel.",20.00,Provence,Rosé
"Bright, fruity aromas of cherries and peaches are offset by brisk acidity, which lead to flavors more along the lines of apple and lime. Fresh and clean, with a hint of chalkiness on the finish.",13.00,Provence,Rosé
"Slightly confected on the nose, with hints of bubble gum that give way to herbal cherry-berry flavors. This plump, medium-bodied rosé finishes smoothly, making it all to easy to down more than one intended.",12.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé
"It's cute critter wine with a name that colorfully relates to what's in the bottle. Peach, sun-warmed stone and anise scents and flavors impart a sense of summer, finishing clean and fresh.",9.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé
"This dark salmon rosé is full-bodied and ripe, with scents of caramelized berries that vie with aromas of grapefruit. Flavors of roasted fruit and chocolate are balanced by a sense of minerality and fresh acidity.",10.00,Rhône_Valley,Rosé
"This popularly priced line of wines continues to offer decent value. This 50-50 blend of Grenache and Syrah features raspberries, black cherries and a nice note of white chocolate that lends additional weight to the wine. Finishes dry.",8.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Grenache-Syrah
"A bit heavy for a rosé, with slightly jammy scents of cooked cherries and berries. Picks up some hints of chocolate on the palate and finish. Best just cooler than room temperature, not ice-bucket cold.",15.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rosé
"This wine ambitiously blends organically grown Cinsault, Grenache and Syrah, but the result is a light, modestly fruited wine that's ultimately a bit innocuous.",10.00,Provence,Rosé
"Slightly nutty and plywoody on the nose, partially redeemed by a plump mouthfeel. Flavors tend toward unripe pear and grapefruit.",7.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"Aromas of sweet strawberries make this an immediately attractive wine. It is lightly colored, with flavors of fresh fruit and just a hint of dryness. Soft and easy, it is almost like alcoholic strawberry juice.",9.00,Beaujolais,Gamay_Noir
"This is a soft, easy wine which lacks focus but makes up for that with its fresh, light fruit and juicy tannins. Drink now and for another year.",8.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Cabernet_Sauvignon
"There are sweet vanilla aromas, along with aromas of green plums. This is a soft, creamy wine, with just a touch of greeness, and a full, creamy texture.",6.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"Probably a little past its best, but still decent, offering simple passion fruit and grapefruit flavors and hints of nectarine. Finishes a bit heavy, lacking the verve you expect in Sauvignon Blanc.",8.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Here is a wine packed with light, fresh juicy red fruits. It has some dry tannins, flavors of herbs and a layer of acidity. This is a good wine for summer drinking.",7.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot
"No lack of weight here, but the heaviness isn't well balanced by big fruit or crisp acids. Instead you get modest pear and peach flavors and a short finish.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"Starts off with a strong burnt matchstick aroma that gradually yields to tart black cherry fruit on the palate. A bit light in body, finishing with a dry astringency.",9.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot
"A highly sweetened wine, which is somewhat coyly called White Merlot. It is soft, sweet and pleasant in its style.",6.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Merlot
"Typical crisp, appley aromas set the scene for a wine with fresh, light, lively fruit and crisp acidity.",9.00,Loire_Valley,Melon
"Slightly grassy on the nose, along with hints of lime and green bean. On the palate, it's light in body, offering only watery green bean flavors.",8.00,Southwest_France,White_Blend
"A firm, tannic wine that promises long aging. The dry tannins are driven by ripe black fruits and flavors of spice and pure acidity.",83.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"One of the great estates of the Graves, This vintage of La Louvière certainly fits into the classic whites of Bordeaux, packing impressive complexity into a wine dominated by Sauvignon Blanc. Intensity has been increased by the use of lees stirring following the Burgundy methods introduced by Denis Dubordieu.",34.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"As with so many other wines from the 2001 vintage, this Palmer is classic Margaux. It has delicacy and elegance, but it also packs power, concentration and dark, dry flavors. Intense and concentrated, the richness of the high proportion of Merlot in Palmer's blend shows through, while the Cabernet Sauvignon gives a fresh lift at the end.",110.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This small estate, dedicated to white wines only, is part of the same stable as Château Haut-Brion itself. This superb wine is packed with ripe, sweet fruit, but equally importantly, shows intensity, layers of wood, a great citrus character and the acidity so typical of 2002. This is a long-term wine: drink in 10–15 years.",135.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Delas has made a Vacqueyras from the 61-acre Domaine des Genets since 1990, and the alluvial soil of the estate gives deep, plummy fruit with rich tannins and a fine layer of acidity. It is not a heavyweight, but is fine and elegant.",19.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A wine that is made from 100% Grenache, giving intense herbal aromas and concentrated, solid fruit. For a Côtes-du-Rhône, this is a big, powerful wine.",30.00,Rhône_Valley,Grenache
"This is a gulpable, satisfying wine that shows plenty of ripeness. Full, soft flavors of ripe black cherries are balanced by notes of coffee and chocolate. Long and harmonious finish.",10.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"There is good deep color with aromas of wood, dry tannins and red berries. A firm, solid wine, it has layers of acidity with a soft sweet aftertaste.",41.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Once the sole claim to fame of this estate was that it was the smallest, as well as one of the most obscure, of the classed growths. Now, its fame come from the quality of its wines. Winemaker Claire Villars-Lurton has crafted a wine that is dark and brooding, with big, powerful, intense fruit, dark flavors and solid tannins. Bordeaux in style, but has a great, polished, ripe feel too.",27.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A powerfully ripe wine, packed with flavors of honeyed fruit, layers of vanilla and delicious richness. This white, from a small parcel in the Lynch-Bages vineyard, is beautifully made in a modern style.",35.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Château de France has improved dramatically in recent years, especially its white wines. With the 2003, packed with wood toast flavors and full of ripe fruit from the warm vintage, there is richness and dense citrus and tropical fruit flavors. With its spice it should develop well over the next few years.",24.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Lagrange, now well at the top among the estates of Saint-Julien, started making a white wine in 1997 again after a break of 25 years. This 2002, from an 8-acre parcel, spent 11 months in wood, and is therefore layered in vanilla flavors. But it is the rich fruit and the balancing acidity that has the last word.",21.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Serious tannins and dense black fruits make this anything but a simple Côtes-du-Rhône. It has long-lived flavors of dark fruits and intense herbs, alongside considerable elegance.",18.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"More harmonious at this stage than the property's Les Choregies luxury cuvée, this wine's supple black cherry and dark chocolate flavors are framed by earthy, leathery notes that culiminate in a complex finish of coffee, earth and juicy fruit.",28.00,Rhône_Valley,Red_Blend
"A blend of Grenache and Syrah, this wine is packed with black fruits and with spice. It is tarry, dense and concentrated. Layers of licorice give complexity to the powerful fruit.",37.00,Rhône_Valley,Grenache-Syrah
"A 100% Marsanne wine, which was vinified and aged in wood for one year. Although the wood is certainly present, the oily, fat fruit is also a powerful element, giving richness and flavors of white peaches.",60.00,Rhône_Valley,Marsanne
"A blend of Grenache Blanc, Clairette and Rousanne, fermented in wood. The result is a complete fruit salad of flavors: apricots, quince and white peaches. Deceptively powerful and intensely aromatic.",18.00,Rhône_Valley,White_Blend
"A great, rich wine from what owner Henri Lurton calls a classic year. There are huge, sweet tannins, solid black fruit flavors and ripeness, without losing sight of balance between richness, dryness and acidity. This is a wine that will age over many years.",40.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Under the same ownership as Giscours, and benefiting from big investment in recent years, this is an estate at the top of its form. The wine has aromas of sweet, new wood, while the palate is packed with tarry fruits and spicy wood and herbs. Flavors of ripe black currants give a rich, satisfying feel. This is a wine that is well structured, dense and, given another five years, will be delicious.",31.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"One of the top producers in the Entre-deux-Mers, Francis Courselle's white has a freshness, lift and crispness that is not always apparent in 2003 whites. But there are also wood flavors to add complexity, and to produce a beautifully balanced wine.",13.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"As we brace ourselves for the crush of this year's Beaujolais Nouveau, it's worth remembering that last year was the year that the region's most famous négociant described as “the vintage [that] may turn out to be the greatest vintage of my career.” It's not the nouveau that turns the “may” into a “will”—it's cru wines like this fragrant, intensely concentrated Juliénas. Here, sweet berry fruit fleshes out into a long, vibrant and persistent wine, one that lingers on the palate for an impossibly long time.",12.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"Black cherries, coffee and dark chocolate combine in this plump wine that starts off a bit mute but comes around with gentle aeration. Charming in the mouth, with enough weight to grab attention without becoming tiring on the palate. Turns spicy, peppery and herbal on the finish.",31.00,Rhône_Valley,Red_Blend
"This is very superior Côtes-du-Rhône, since the vines are actually in Côtes-du-Rhône-Villages. But winemaker Jean-Pierre Meffre prefers to keep the name simple and the wine uncomplicated. Sweet, ripe fruit, solid tannins and red fruit flavors make this very attractive.",12.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A very dry style of Champagne that needs food. At this stage, this wine is young, with vibrant acidity  and dense, green fruit. But it has a long future ahead of it, and shortly should show some toast and maturity. Serve this with fish, and appreciate its qualities even more. Imported by Robert Chadderdon Selections.",120.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This Pinot Noir-dominated wine is rich and structured with waves of acidity passing through the white currant, toast and a developing maturity. Extra richness comes from the oak fermentation, but, because of the low dosage, there is also an austerity and minerality about this wine that will find its best expression with food. Imported by Winebow.",90.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This Champagne, full of richness and fresh acidity, is a wine designed for food. With its weight and intensity of flavor, along with the low dosage, it is still full-bodied, leaving a toasty character. This is the 729th nonvintage blending produced by Jacquesson since 1898 (when the house was 100 years old), hence the number. Imported by Winebow.",45.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is a bone dry, deliciously mature Champagne. The fruit aromas and flavors are now submerged beneath a layer of toast. A very fine wine, packed in a beautiful bottle designed by Van Cleef and Arpels. Imported by Remy Cointreau USA.",120.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A blend made entirely from grand cru vineyards, this is a superbly ripe, full wine; a very different, richer one from the normally light Taittinger style. A great Champagne, impressive and worth aging. Imported by Kobrand.",70.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"One of the great nonvintage Champagnes, this is a wine with considerable bottle age, full of toasty flavors. With its gooseberry and apple fruit flavors, it is still fresh, but its great character comes from its supreme elegance. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",40.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This multivintage blend nails the essence of Krug, intense richness of fruit and flavor without weight. Meaty mushroom and soy aromas are balanced by rich red fruits, citrus, toast and mineral notes. Long finish. Imported by Clicquot Inc.",172.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A 100% Chardonnay blanc de blancs that is presented without any dosage to soften the acidity. Yet it doesn't seem to matter, because this Champagne is deliciously ripe, packed with mature fruit flavors, a touch of almonds to go with the white currant tastes and a layer of toastiness. Imported by Michael Skurnik Wines.",55.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"From five grand cru vineyards in the Côte des Blancs, this 100% Chardonnay is a great wine, with some toast and almond flavors showing good bottle age, along with freshness, finesse, ripe white fruits and a structured, lingering aftertaste. Imported by Robert Chadderdon Selections.",65.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"The latest vintage from Gosset, this rich, intense wine is still young, its acidity showing through strongly. But it has great depth, complex green and white fruit flavors, a hint of toast just showing and the promise of many years' aging. As it ages, it will reveal more and more flavors that will stand up to even the richest of foods. Imported by Palm Bay Imports.",85.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"The Bollinger style is always rich, food friendly and impressive. This wine is all of those things, with power and intensity of flavor along with ripe fruit, a layer of toastiness and a dry aftertaste. This is a style of wine that can take even more bottle aging. Imported by Paterno Wines International.",50.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A taut, tight wine, packed with wood and rich fruit flavors but still developing. When it matures in a year, this top wine from Rauzan Despagne will have enormous, intense fruit. This is a great white wine, one that shows how good white from the Entre-deux-Mers can be.",16.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"The 2001 is rich, dense, concentrated, with dusty tannins and solid black fruits. The palate is rich and spicy, with new wood flavors supporting firm, ripe fruit. The wine is still young, with dry fruit tannins and a layer of acidity, and excellent potential.",22.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A quarter century of improvements have made their positive mark on the wines of Marquis de Terme, as revealed in this 2001. It is a generously opulent wine, with its richness and soft tannins, but the spice, the dryness and ripe acidity give it structure and balance. It has good aging potential, but, with its richness, could be drunk now.",29.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"One of the stars of Margaux, Monbrison 2001 is packed with rich, powerful black fruits, with open, generous fruit flavors and great new-wood flavors. This is an impressive, modern wine, powered with dense fruit, as well as some elegance and style.",45.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Thieuley's top white, named after the owner, is an intense wine, with honey and acidity in great balance. There are flavors of almonds and vanilla from wood aging. A great white Bordeaux from the Entre-deux-Mers region.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Denis Dubordieu, professor of oenology at Bordeaux University, is credited with having introduced white Burgundy style of winemaking to Bordeaux, with whole bunch maceration and barrel fermentation as important elements. From his Graves estate, Clos Floridène is a beautifully formed wine, with lemon, white peach and grapefruit flavors, and supporting (never dominating) wood.",30.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Produced by Jonathan Maltus, who also makes the superstar Saint-Emilion wine, Le Dôme, this is a beautifully crafted wine that brings together tropical fruits, flavors of quince and creamy vanilla. There is some good acidity, despite the hot year, which brings everything into balance.",100.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Made by a vigneron, which means a guy named Lavantureux actually grew the grapes and made the wine himself. It also means, at least in theory, that it received a lot of TLC. Not cheap, but an excellent value among French Chardonnay. It offers nothing but the purest of fruit: pineapple, mango, apple and then a smooth slide toward a sleek finish. Seek the vintage if possible. Yet another winner courtesy of veteran importer Kermit Lynch.",18.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Muscadet has changed since we all rejected it in favor of New World whites. This French region at the mouth of the Loire river now makes clean, fresh, light wines which are almost certainly the best accompaniment to shellfish there is. This estate wine is full-bodied, with a touch of toast and soft, ripe fruit. Finely focused, it is complex with green fruits and ripeness combined.",11.00,Loire_Valley,Muscadet
"While the German wines downriver get all the press, few consumers even know of this tiny French wine region. More should, as wines like this are perfect accompaniments to today's light cuisine. This wine, a blend of 30% Auxerrois, 30% Müller-Thurgau, 30% Pinot Gris and 10% Gewürztraminer, layers elegant flavors of peach, melon and green apple over an earthy, minerally core. Its modest alcohol level and lively acidity make it a natural as an apéritif, and versatile at the table.",13.00,France_Other,White_Blend
"Clean and simple, with apple, lime and pineapple flavors. Very zingy and lemony on the finish, and thoroughly tangy at every check point. This could use more ripe flavor and style, but what's here is fine, especially if your expectations are modest.",19.00,Alsace,Riesling

"Selected from the eight grand cru villages in which Madame owned vineyards, this lean, youthful wine is delicious now but could use additional bottle age to broaden out. Toasty and citrusy, there's a lot of fruit here, yet it retains a great sense of elegance.",180.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend

Imported by Allied Domecq Wines USA.",60.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Tasted from a magnum disgorged in '97, this provides ample evidence that '85 was a great year for Clicquot. Toasty, but seems less evolved than the '85 Brut, with a deep copper color, meaty, savory aromas, berry flavors and a full, creamy texture. Long on the finish. It's made from the same base as the '85 Brut, but with 14.5% red from Bouzy added.",250.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A blend of 70% Pinot Noir and 30% Chardonnay, this is a true food Champagne. “Our objective was to show how powerful Pinot Noir can get in our wines,” says Charles Philipponnat, and he is right. It is rich but dry, concentrated, slightly spicy, with weight and intensity without losing freshness from the acidity. Imported by Ex-Cellars Wine Agencies, Inc.",63.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Since he created his company in 1981, Bruno Paillard has become an important force in Champagne, owning a number of other brands. But his top wines are made under his own name; they go for finesse and elegance. This bottling also has a touch of mature, toasty acid flavors. The bottles carry the year of disgorgement—an excellent idea. Imported by Vintus LLC.",44.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend

"There is great intensity to this finely crafted Champagne. It's rich and toasty, with flavors of ripe gooseberries and, in this example, some good bottle age.

"An extra dry Champagne created to commemorate the founding of Philipponnat in 1522 (the firm is still run by the same family). This is a particularly mature style of Champagne, rich and biscuity. With fresh acidity, and a dry finish, this is definitely a food Champagne. Imported by Ex-Cellars Wine Agencies, Inc.",65.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"With no dosage, this is a very dry wine that has benefited from some good bottle aging. It is also darker in color than some rosés, which gives the wine considerable body and richness. Imported by Remy Cointreau USA.",45.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"The tiny mousse tells a lot about the quality of this impressive Champagne. It is quite full in style, with flavors of white currants and a rich, but still bone-dry aftertaste. It is a perfect food Champagne, with structure and a good tension between richness and elegance. Imported by Robert Chadderdon Selections.",45.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Very clean, young and fresh, with tremendous aging potential. Pineapple and Golden Delicious give it primary, young-fruit flavors that need years to develop. This rating may look stingy in time. Imported by Paterno Wines International.",200.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is a superb wine, broad and rich but with complexity from mature vines and wood aging. For a 2003—a hot year—this still brings together some great acidity. Can drink now, but will age over the next 10 years.",30.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"A powerful and weighty wine, even from the lighter 2002 vintage. Château Margaux's white is made with the same attention to detail as the reds, balancing fresh acidity, richness, layers of wood and great sophistication. It will age over 5–10 years.",58.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"The moated castle of Issan belongs to the Cruse family, one of Bordeaux's most famous. Under the direction of Emmanuel Cruse, and with consultant Jacques Boissenot, the estate is enjoying something of a renaissance. With its great, generous, rich and sweet fruit, its ripe tannins and its black jelly flavors, it makes a powerful statement. Wood is there, but doesn't dominate. The wine will develop over the next 5–10 years.",29.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Under the same control as Château Ferrière, this wine reveals the same sense of power, style and elegance. It is polished, packed with ripe fruit and dense tannins. Tobacco and cedar aromas make this an immediately enticing wine that still offers great potential for aging.",21.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Sweet, soft and missing some chords along the way. The palate has corn-like, soft flavors, while the finish is mealy and tastes like bananas. Bland and flat, as if its good days are behind it.",30.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Snappy and clean, although some might find this Alsatian blend austere and sharp. The palate features sour apple and some asparagus, and the finish is more of the same. The forwardness and acid-based balance are both admirable, but the flavor profile leaves something to be desired.",11.00,Alsace,White_Blend
"This white blend has some lemon-lime aromas and also a hint of flowery perfume. It smells pretty good, but that promise isn't upheld on the palate, where things turn broad and dull. There just isn't much intensity or depth to the wine, which finishes spicy and dry.",16.00,Alsace,White_Blend
"Full-bodied and rich, with mouthfilling toast and citrus flavors that go on and on. Adds complex chalk and mineral notes on the finish. Drink now or hold. Imported by Maisons Marques & Domaines USA.",71.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A classic nonvintage Champagne, Brut Premier is also a yardstick by which others are measured. In the case of this bottle, that yardstick is working well: the palate is rich and creamy, there is maturity along with great fruit and elegance. Best as an apéritif wine, this could also go with light foods. Imported by Maisons Marques & Domaines USA.",52.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Great toasty aromas sweep out of the glass with this delicious wine. It has ripe fruit rather than high dosage, giving the richness of Chardonnay with tastes of white peaches and apricots. A fine wine.  Imported by Michael Skurnik Wines.",52.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"A fine, very pure style of Champagne. Has hints of toast and citrus fruits that come together in a style that is almost the essence of Champagne. Crisp, rich and complex. Imported by Kobrand.",35.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Like the regular Grande Dame, the aim here is finesse. It's softer and more elegant than Clicquot's vintage rosé, with delicate hints of cherry, toast, mushroom and citrus. Long, tight and tannic on the finish, this wine is worth cellaring.",200.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A bone-dry but delicious wine, with red fruits and a beautiful onion-skin color that just hints at rosé. Lovely acidity completes the serious and highly enjoyable wine. Imported by Robert Chadderdon Selections.",68.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Also tasted out of magnum, although the price listed is for a single bottle. This rivals the '85, delivering great complexity and a rich, round mouthfeel.",235.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"The richer vintage wines from Boizel are often best with food. This 1998, a blend of 55% Pinot Noir and 45% Chardonnay, has the right combination of creaminess and richness along with flavors of raspberries and fresh acidity. Imported by Winebow.",35.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Produced from biodynamically cultivated vineyards. This wine gushes fruit, with great pure crisp flavors and deliciously clean acidity as part of the finish. Imported by Michael Skurnik Wines.",53.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"The dry style of Philipponnat, with its Pinot Noir dominance, demands bottle aging, which the bottle tasted had. It has good structure, and intense grapefruit and orange peel flavors. A finely made wine, which is also a good value. Imported by Ex-Cellars Wine Agencies, Inc.",40.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"No doubt Le Roi Soleil (Louis XIV, the Sun King) would have downed plenty of Champagne given half a chance, so I'm surprised this is the first wine I have come across named after one of history's great hedonists. This is actually quite a delicate wine, crisp and fresh, with a deliciously clean streak of acidity.",41.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Toasty and nutty at first, but with aeration the fruit emerges—first as pungent passion fruit, then more elegantly as nectarine and limes. Finishes long, fresh and clean—a wine that can be drunk now and over the next five years, possibly longer.",33.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Gonzague Lurton, current president of the Margaux producers, has invested considerably in pushing this estate forward. The wine has rich, open, generous fruit, with soft but firmly present tannins and juicy flavors. Combined with a subtle used of new wood, this shows well, and will develop well over many years.",26.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"The style of Cantenac-Brown is generally softer, richer than other Margaux, and this 2001 is no exception. It has a perfumed character, which has sweet, meaty flavors over ripe fruit. It has exotic spices, layered with dark wood and red fruits. To finish, there are dark tarry flavors and a blackberry-jelly freshness.",37.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"When Andre Lurton bought Couhins in 1970, he followed a long-established Bordeaux tradition and added his name to the name of the property. This is a delicious, grassy wine, 100% Sauvignon Blanc, with flavors of pink grapefruit, along with some spice from wood aging. There is firm acidity to the finish.",32.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"A big wine from this classed-growth Graves estate, it has both oak and ripe fruit integrated well with quince and grapefruit flavors. To finish, there is a great lift of acidity.",37.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"This great Barsac château also produces small quantities of dry white wine in most years. It is rich and creamy, with apricots as well as white peaches over the layer of spicy wood.",34.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"The berry fruit is rather mute and marked by sour herb and woody accents. There's also a slight meatiness but the overall impression is thin. As with too many Southern French offerings, it needs more fruit density to be taken seriously. Closes short with very light licorice-vanilla notes.",9.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
"This lightweight, tart-cherry flavored wine displays some coffee and game notes on the nose. The aromas and flavors are correct, but it's a bit hollow. It lacks the body (and shows more sourness) that most enthusiasts would want from an inexpensive quaff.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Shiraz
"An example of the new style of wines that are beginning to emerge from the Languedoc: Rather than the sour, earthy wines of the past, the focus is on the fruit, which is bouncy and sweet. Flavors of grapes, bananas and bubble gum mark this as a Beaujolais-style Syrah best consumed slightly chilled.",7.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
"What flavors could be discerned on the closed, mute nose were akin to wet socks, flea powder, curry and tomato. Flavors are spicy, cherry and peppery, though somewhat green. Some called it “exotic;” others said “two percent fruit.” Finish fades fast.",9.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
"On the earthy side, with aromas of damp wood and toast that far outweigh the modest blackberry fruit. It's medium weight, with a tart finish.",7.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
"Knockout Sauvignon Blanc aromas of gooseberry and pink grapefruit are followed on the palate by similar flavors, all graced with great intensity and precision. Cheverny is in Touraine, in the Loire Valley, and this wine represents a fine alternative to pricier Sancerres or New Zealand Sauvignon Blancs. Not so pungent that it can't be consumed on its own, yet assertive enough to pair with any Sauvignon-friendly dish.",12.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"The new VF line from Beaucastel's Perrin family is a stunning statement of affordable quality. Screw-capped and plainly packaged, Lasira delivers the goods where it counts: in the bottle. The blend is three-quarters Syrah, one-quarter Grenache, and as the label points out, 0% cork. Bright, spicy and showing sharp berry flavors, this fruit and acid-driven bottling is a classy new wine for a new generation of wine drinkers.",9.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Wow. This classy, ripe chateau-bottled rosé is from the eastern Langeudoc, sometimes called Chateâuneuf-du-Pape South. Mainly Syrah with a little Grenache, it was fermented in steel to preserve freshness, and oak-aged. Smooth and ripe in cherries, with fresh Provençal herbs and a hint of flowers, it has minerally acids and tons of finesse. Full enough to drink with red meats.",10.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"This is a delicious, full-bodied rosé from the mouth of the Rhône in southern France. It is full of ripe strawberry fruit flavors. This is what fresh, fruity rosé is all about. It may not be summer for another six months, but this makes a great apéritif wine. You could even drink it with the Thanksgiving turkey.",12.00,Rhône_Valley,Rosé
"After a tough 2002 vintage, Delas has bounced back nicely with this wine, which shows uncommon depth and intensity for a humble Côtes du Ventoux. Bold scents of black cherries, blackberries and earth rise from the glass and there's plenty of richness on the palate, even some slightly rustic tannins to help rein in all that fruit. Notes of licorice, tar and earth on the finish make it more than a simple fruit bomb.",10.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Enticing aromas of white fruits set the scene for a wine that is very fresh, very crisp, the epitome of dry, clean, delicious Chardonnay. It has great acidity and a crisp, clear dry aftertaste. Imported by Henriot USA.",50.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Toasty and rich-smelling, like brioche, but it isn't one-dimensional, as it picks up fruitier notes of apple and citrus. Ends on a chalky note. Imported by Vranken America.",120.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Formerly known as Crémant de Cramant (a name now banned because it refers to sparkling wines from Burgundy, Alsace, the Loire and Limoux), Mumm continues to make this blanc de blancs, which is famed for its lightness. It is great to see they are also giving the wine some bottle age, which brings out delicious, toasty, nutty characters. Imported by Allied Domecq Wines USA.",61.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"A rare rosé made by obtaining the color from the skins of the Pinot during maceration, rather than by adding red wine. It gives a rich style of rosé with full red fruit flavors and a touch of tannin. This is definitely a food-friendly rosé. Imported by Duval-Leroy Imports.",42.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"With evocative gold-painted Paris scenes decorating the bottle, this is obviously a because it works beautifully as a light, vivacious wine, with deliciously clean, not quite green, fruit. Imported by Duval-Leroy Imports.",35.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"With its bottle shape dating from the late 16th century, this is a traditionally made rosé, using color from macerating Pinot Noir grapes. It is full, ripe, flavored with strawberries and other sweet red fruits, with a layer of dryness. The wine finishes fresh and crisp. Imported by Laurent-Perrier.",60.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"With a touch of caramel aromas, this appears initially soft. But the palate is very dry and light, balanced with flavors of lychees and red fruits. Finishes with clean acidity. Imported by Vintus LLC.",55.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Gems like this from the stellar 2000 vintage are still available to consumers willing to explore lesser-known chateaus. Concentrated scents of black cherries and cassis emerge from the glass, followed by admirably pure flavors of black cherries and vanilla. It's supple enough to drink now, but appears to have the stuffing to go another 5–10 years. A long, berry-filled finish caps off this find.",45.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A ripe wine that is polished almost as bright as a diamond. Big, chocolaty flavors are balanced by some acidity and soft tannins. This is a seductive wine that belies the quality of the vintage, showing concentration and sweet, dense fruit.",33.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Château Mouton Rothschild's white wine fits easily into the rich, modern style favored for the château's reds. There are layers of vanilla and wood, with a ripe, round creaminess. Could age, due to good depth of flavor and some complexity from the acidity.",60.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"While the latter years of Lichine family ownership saw a decline in the quality of this estate, new owners have brought about a remarkable renaissance. This 2001 is rich and confident, with layers of wood that balance well with blackberry and currant jelly fruits. This is developing into a serious, impressive wine.",35.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"It is rare to find a white wine from Saint-Emilion, so this is at least a curiosity. But it is also a wonderful, rich wine, with creamy, toasty flavors and ripe white fruits. It's fresh and ripe, and finishes with its spicy notes.",29.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Wood gives complexity to the wine's rich, soft fruit. Flavors of quince, honey and grapefruit blend well with the vanilla of the wood. This is the top white cuvée from Bertinerie, produced from old vines.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"From the irrepressible Randall Grahm's Languedoc label, this Syrah boasts aromas of sour berries, cedar and saddle leather that evolve on the palate into indistinct black murkiness. Narrowly constructed, with a tart, charcoally finish.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
"Stewed dark fruit with leather and spice accents show on the nose of this angular, narrow wine. Very dry on the tongue, it offers black coffee and smoke flavors and high acidity. A taut finish closes this lean machine.",13.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
The core of plummy fruit in this kosher Syrah has an odd combination of lemony tartness and an almost Band-Aid flavor. One taster perceived an unusual green olive-caper note which doesn't necessarily help things. Offers a wood-accented sour lemon finish.,11.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
"The dilute, grapey flavors are candied, and a pile of charred lumber doesn't make them go down any easier. A simple wood-and-juice quaff.",7.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
"Grassy, hay-like aromas vie with scents of sweaty gym clothes in this light, tart Syrah. Barely acceptable.",10.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Under a veil of skunk cabbage, there's a wine waiting to emerge—but when it does, there's not much to it. Bland, earthy and tart, with dull red fruit. Pass.",15.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
"Salmon-pink in color, this delicious rosé has great elegance and pure red fruit flavors. Finishes fresh, with lively acidity and almond flavors. A great apéritif style of rosé. Imported by Ex-Cellars Wine Agencies, Inc.",48.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Onion-skin color leads to a wine that is packed with deep fruit flavors. Considerably dry but a great food wine, with good acidity and ability to age well in bottle. The sample tasted was too young, and needed at least a year's aging. Imported by Domaine Select Wine Estates.",110.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Features an interesting blend of flavors that range from mature mushroom and toast notes to youthful apples and stone fruits. Throughout, there's a crisp, minerally undercurrent. Imported by Maisons Marques & Domaines USA.",158.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Toasty aromas follow through to a soft, creamy wine that has light acidity, ripeness and full Chardonnay flavors. This is a delicious, full-bodied wine, produced by a small family-owned firm in Le Mesnil sur Oger. Imported by Premier Wine & Spirits.",33.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A lighter style, with a creamy texture and a crisp, youthful feel. Lemon and toast dominate, but there's a deep apple and mineral core lurking below. Imported by Remy Cointreau USA.",65.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Under the ownership of the Cazes family (also owners of Lynch-Bages), this estate produces richly satisfying wines, even in lighter years like 2002. This is finely constructed, with acidity along with the tannins and dense black fruits. It certainly has power, but there is also great elegance.",27.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Old vines, low yields and fermentation in wood give great complexity to this top cuvée from the Despagne family. There is a touch of wood flavor to this wine, but the main impression is of delicious, fresh fruit that has gained maturity from bottle age. It is in balance, with good acidity to give it a final lift.",19.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"One of the many Pessac-Léognan properties owned by Andre Lurton, Cruzeau has a long history dating back to the 18th century. This 2000 vintage, now totally mature, has great vanilla flavors that balance well with the intense grapefruit flavors and toasty aromas.",17.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"The quality of Faugères continues to be impressive, none more so than in lesser vintages. This 2002, with its fine structure, balancing tannins, fruit and acidity is dry but has layers of tarry black fruit flavors, leaving a great, fresh, lifted taste in the mouth.",35.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This property, owned by the Cazes family of Château Lynch-Bages, has produced a really stylish, fresh, full-bodied wine. The fruit is rich, with a well-judged layer of wood and flavors of ripe green plums.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"A powerful, spicy wine that is dominated by wood and toast. The fruit is black but relatively lightweight, and is suffering at this stage from the strong wood flavors.",21.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"One of the many Margaux estates under the control of the Lurton family, this is a classic wine, with dry wood and dark tannins, flavors of black currants and light acidity. There is no mistaking this as Bordeaux, with its serious, ageworthy fruits and tannins.",43.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Normally Ugni Blanc and Colombard grapes are distilled into Cognac or Armagnac, but owner Yves Grassa has chosen to turn these pedestrian varieties into a clean, crisp, dry wine that exudes grapefruit and green-apple characteristics along with a nice smack of herbaceousness. In addition, there are aromatic notes of pine and weighty flavors of mango and banana. Not a long ager, however, as the 2002 version I also tried had lost its steam.",8.00,Southwest_France,White_Blend
"I'll admit upfront that I have a soft spot for this wine—the 1985 version was the first wine I purchased by the case (I think the whole case set me back about $60). The wine remains a bargain, even though the price tag has roughly doubled. The aromas this year are pretty restrained, but the wine explodes on the palate, giving up impressive flavors of plum, blackberry, earth and pepper, along with hints of anise and tar. The long finish confirms its quality.",12.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Pommery's light, almost ethereal style seems to have survived its many changes of ownership. A fine toasty character marks this delicious, crisp, refreshing Champagne. Imported by W. J. Deutsch & Sons.",37.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A pale rose color sets the scene for great flavors of wild strawberries and red currants. This a light, fresh, crisp rosé, which has poised acidity at the end. Very attractive. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd.",70.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A crisp, dry style, packed with heady, perfumed Pinot. This is definitely a Champagne for food, and works with its extra weight and richness. Imported by Grape Expectations of Georgia.",44.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is typical of the light, floating style of Perrier-Jouët. There is richness and a soft finish from a relatively high dosage, but the wine is also elegant, leaving flavors of orange peel and a touch of toast. Imported by Allied Domecq Wines USA.",49.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Great fresh Chardonnay flavors give this Champagne a good lift. It is fresh, but has some good structure, as well as enticing, creamy, nutty flavors. The acidity gives the whole wine a sense of crispness.",36.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Mumm's flagship Champagne is hugely improved. There is richness, flavors of white peaches and orange peel and just a touch of softness balanced by good structure. This is a fine wine that today holds its own with its competitors. Imported by Allied Domecq Wines USA.",43.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This four-year-old bottling (indicated on the back label) is a rich Champagne, with some toasty maturity but also flavors of almonds, white currants and citrus peel. It is an intense, full-bodied food wine. Imported by Remy Cointreau USA.",40.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Almost bone dry, this Champagne can be difficult to appreciate, layered with acidity and green fruit. But get beneath its dryness and the fruit is surprisingly ripe, with pink grapefruit flavors. This is a wine that demands bottle aging to soften the acidity, so an indication of disgorgement would be helpful. Imported by Laurent-Perrier.",49.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Blonde de Seigneur was first produced by Georges Vernay in 2000. It is a wine which shows up elegance rather than power, great black fruit expression with fine tannins. It has some dry tannic structure, but there is plenty of fruit here, perfumed and with layers of smoky wood. A really great wine from a medium vintage.",55.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"This is a great, generous wine, packed with dark fruit and tannins. It comes from a well-drained vineyard on the slopes of the hill of Hermitage. There's dry tannins, but they are overwhelmed by the huge spice, herbal,    and blackberry jelly flavors. It should age well over 10-20 years.",80.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Condrieu doesn't have to be overpowering, as Vernay, a master of Viognier, demonstrates in this wine. Aromas of almonds, flavors of fresh apricots and white peaches, a lively, vibrant acidity blend well into a poised, elegant wine.  It seems to last for ever in the mouth.",60.00,Rhône_Valley,Viognier
"An amazingly perfumed wine, which shows great tannins and ripe fruit. It has a fine structure, packed with smoky wood and blackberry flavors. It is still young, but wait for its dark fruit to open out, and for its ripe, intense violets and tarry flavors to balance, and it will be an impressive wine.",90.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"The Bessards vineyard is right at the heart of the Hermitage hill. Delas only makes this wine in top years (no 2002, for example), and the quality shows in the aromas of black fruits and violets, the flavors of huge, dense fruit and powerful tannins. This is serious wine, which promises at least 10 years of aging.",122.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"An exotic, perfumed wine, with aromas of violets and rosewater. To taste, this exoticism goes through to ripe, but elegant fruit. Along with all this, there is a freshness and fruitiness which makes the wine light, fragrant and vibrant.",92.00,Rhône_Valley,Viognier
"Albrecht made only 25 cases of this SGN, but if you can find it, it's worth a try. Aromas of caramelized orange peel and ripe melon suggest sweetness--and the wine is sweet--just not dessert-sweet. It's oily and viscous on the palate, conveying an impression of great weight and richness along with flavors of dried spices and citrus. Pair with foie gras or cheeses.",67.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"The exuberance of this wine, full of ripe black fruits with great acidity, smoky wood and pure flavors, pushes Cuilleron's wines up to a new level. This is a solid, tannic wine which at the same time has vibrancy and great fruit.",38.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"There's a hint of kerosene to this wine's ripe, yet minerally, aromas. Shows a muscular, sturdy structure in the mouth, which should allow it age gracefully, slowly evolving from melon and pear fruit to exhibit the more mineral aspects it displays on the finish.",32.00,Alsace,Riesling
"A fine, elegant white wine, rich with wood and toast flavors overlying the white peaches and pink grapefruit.",50.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"This is the Castillon wine from the Saint-Émilion estate of Faugères, which is split in half by commune boundaries. The same care goes into this great value wine as into the Saint-Émilion, and this is a fine wine, full of superripe fruit and blackberry flavors.",20.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Angludet is the story of an estate that has been built up painstakingly over several decades. The Sichels, whose family home this is, make very satisfying wines, which are always good values. The 2001, with its good structure, its black fruits and its sympathetic use of wood, has balance and elegance. Ripe fruits with tobacco aromas complete the package.",25.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Huge investment is paying off at Labegorce. And it has not resulted in a wine that is simply modern in style. For here the new wood is well integrated, the fruit is structured, and never too extracted, and the ripeness also has layers of Bordeaux dryness.",50.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Lovely acidity dominates this wine, the top white wine from Dominique Haverlan's Vieux Château Gaubert. It is fresh and crisp, with wood underlying attractive apples and cream flavors. A fresh and lively, but also serious, wine.",25.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"A big, rich wine that is dominated by wood and ripe fruit. One of its range of appellation wines, Dourthe has set out to show the quality of simple Graves, and has succeeded well with this wine, powered with superripe fruit and creamy intensity.",14.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"The heat-drenched 2003 vintage has given this wine far more weight and flesh than is typical. Although this may turn off some Muscadet fans, it gives folks who haven't yet discovered Muscadet a relatively easy introduction to the genre. It's filled with soft stone fruit and melon flavors, but it still retains the briny, minerally soul of its appellation and a lingering finish.",10.00,Loire_Valley,Muscadet
"When my wife, normally no great fan of rosé, says, “I really like this wine,” that's an endorsement you can take to the bank. Aromas of wild berries and melon are reserved, the punch solid, and the color a lovely light salmon. This Provençal wine is good year in and year out, so there's no reason not to expect the same from the upcoming 2004. A great summertime refresher that goes down fast and easy. Excellent with salads topped with vinaigrettes.",10.00,Provence,Rosé
"The current release of the vintage wine, the 1998 seems a touch richer than the '99, with hints of brioche, mushroom and ginger to its citrusy flavors. Round and soft in the mouth, but also a little short on the finish.",76.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A full style of wine, with a touch of toast. This is rich, with flavors of white fruits as well as a layer of acidity that comes through. An attractive wine from a firm that is on the way up. Imported by Duval-Leroy Imports.",27.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"In an attempt to lighten the image of Champagne, Pommery has gone for a light style of wine and an equally light name, which harks back to the 1930s description of Champagne. Luckily, it is not all marketing, and the wine is good, with some bottle age, along with a poise and charm, which certainly works. Imported by W. J. Deutsch & Sons.",11.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"The vintage wines from Clicquot are consistently richer and fuller than either the nonvintage or La Grande Dame. Toast and custard scents, followed by youthful notes of apple and citrus. Long, even a bit tannic-feeling, on the finish. Arrives this December, but the price was not available at press time.",60.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Probably the best-selling Champagne brand in the world, with a production of over 30 million bottles a year, Moët's quality is consistent. It has a ripeness and richness, and in this bottle, some bottle age. This bottling is not hugely fruity, but it has more to offer than just fruit. Imported by Moët Hennessy USA.",38.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This is a very polished modern style of Champagne. It has almond flavors, layered with toast and green fruit. In the delicate style of Bruno Paillard Champagnes, this is certainly an apéritif wine. Imported by Vintus LLC.",59.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"Floral and fruity on the nose, with lots of forward cherry aromas. It's 15% Bouzy, but not tannic at all, with an elegant mouthfeel and a long, silky finish.",86.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"This deep rose-colored Champagne is full-bodied with ripe, fresh fruit flavors. There is acidity but with the very fruity character of this wine, it is one which can be drunk relatively young and fresh. Imported by Kobrand.",70.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Biscuit aromas are a good starter for this bone-dry Champagne, which works because of bottle aging. It is crisp, full of biscuit tastes with some green fruits. It also has a tannic structure; piercingly dry overall. Imported by De Saint Gall.",65.00,Champagne,Chardonnay
"A fruit-driven wine, with aromas of dried apples, pineapple and citrus, even a bit of honey. Flavors verge on tropical, but it boasts a creamy texture and a crisp, dry finish. A bit New World in style, but well done. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",28.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Right now, this wine tastes like a somewhat generic red wine--albeit one with excellent balance, fine oaking and impressive concentration and length. Cedary, vanilla notes from new oak barrels need some time to integrate with the rich black cherry fruit and allow the true flavors of Châteauneuf to shine. Drink 2008–2015.",89.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Spice and blackcurrant aromas are combined with solid tannins and powerful wood flavors to give a spectacular, polished style, a contrast to the  often rustic wines that come from this appellation. The wine comes from 90-year old vines that are then aged in 70% new wood for 18 months.",86.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"From a small parcel of 12 acres of Condrieu on the steep slope of the Coteau de Chery, Gilbert Clusel and Brigitte Roch have made a beautifully crafted Condrieu, ripe and unctuous and with wood flavors from barrel fermentation and aging. Honey flavors dominate this delicious wine.",52.00,Rhône_Valley,Viognier
"Here's a great juicy wine, with rich fruit flavors. It has flavors of blackcurrant and other black fruits, with spices and bitter chocolate. There are dry tannins from the 12 months' wood aging. From the single vineyard Les Lauves, it leaves a great spicy, toasty aftertaste.",25.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Supple and easy to drink, this is as good an introduction to Cote-Rotie as any. Minerally and tinged with beef blood on the nose, then showing solid berry flavors accented by herbal notes on the palate. Develops meaty notes on the finish. With 25,000 cases produced, it's the Cote-Rotie consumers are most likely to find.",60.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"This is a plump, soft, inviting wine. It opens with a bit of gently toasted oatmeal and citrus, then expands on the palate to reveal smoke and lemon custard flavors. Consume this over the next couple of years for its luscious forwardness, or cellar it, as it should fine in 2010 or so.",45.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"Smoky wood aromas, with pure black fruits are a great start for this serious wine. Considering it comes from the less good 2002 vintage, it has great ripe fruit, which balances with dark, dry tannins and acidity. There is plenty of potential here, as well - give it 10 years.",64.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Big black fruit aromas on this serious, intense and concentrated wine, which is a blend from different Hermitage vineyards. It shows acidity and firm structure, with some leathery character. Great, solid dark fruits, and prominent wood flavors show how this wine has potential - aging for 10 years at least.",75.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"A powerful, dark and tannic wine which reflects the power of this wine from 30-year old vines. It has great intense fruits, with some austerity at this young stage, but will ripen and richen over the next 5 years. Ferraton is partly owned by Chapoutier, and affect to call their Crozes-Hermitage and Hermitage by the older spelling of Ermitage.",76.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"A fine effort from this reliable cru bourgeois, the 2002 Rollan de By boasts hints of toast and vanilla in its bouquet, but mostly offers up solid cassis fruit, with just a whiff of dried herbs. A velvety, supple texture and lush tannins suggest early drinkability. Try now–2010.",32.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"A complex, ripe wine from one of the high achievers in the Graves. It has intense, flowery aromas, with a touch of vanilla and fresh, grassy character. Has grapefruit flavors; could age over five years.",17.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"This crus bourgeois has improved dramatically in recent years under the control of Jean-Louis Triaud. This 2002 is dense and dark, with solid spice and wood-driven fruit. At this stage, it is still tannic, but, for the year, is a powerful wine.",32.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Dourthe's branded Bordeaux is one of the best around, and this white from vintage 2003 is no exception. With its ripe, honeyed fruit, it is delicious both as an apéritif and as a food wine. Layers of soft creaminess are backed by fine crisp acidity.",10.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"This 2003, fat and full, shows skilled winemaking, extracting intensity of flavor and a fine balance from a hot, superripe year. Toast and cream flavors at the fore, along with a light touch of acidity.",17.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Throwing a healthy sediment already, this blend of Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre could actually use another six months or so to drop additional tannin. It's an unusually forceful vintage for this wine, which is usually friendly and forward. Although in many years it tends toward red fruit flavors, the 2001 is graced with black cherry fruit and complex notes of tree bark, earth and pepper.",9.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Has Picard's signature oak treatment in spades, with cedar, cinnamon and clove notes, but also strident cherry flavors that show enough promise to warrant cellaring 5–8 years. Long on the finish, which seems oaky right now, but the fruit wins out in the end.",30.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A 50/50 blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, this is a full-bodied wine, with layers of toast and some good maturity. It has good nutty flavors, as well as white fruits, some bitter orange and a balanced, soft aftertaste. Imported by Tri-Vin Imports.",65.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Light and delicate, this is a blanc de blancs worthy of the name. Toasty and biscuity on the nose, with flavors of citrus, green apple and chalk dust. Imported by Hand Picked Selections.",41.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A very lean, dry style that focuses on its acidity and green fruits. This makes it a style that needs good bottle aging—the sample tasted was too young. But for those who like dry, crisp Champagnes, this is beautifully made. Imported by Domaine Select Wine Estates.",50.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Yeasty aromas set the scene for a wine that is fresh, crisp and not long in bottle. It is an attractive Champagne, and its grapefruit and lime flavors are refreshing. Pre-dinner drinks would be a good moment for this wine. Imported by Grape Expectations of Georgia.",43.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Pear and honey scents presage luscious flavors of ripe pears, melon and dried spices. It's medium-bodied and dry with a long finish that shows a touch of alcoholic warmth, so opt for drinking it over the next few years.",36.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"The ever increasing range of Yves Cuilleron's wines includes a number of single parcel wines, especially from his Saint-Joseph holdings. This wine, from the Lombard vineyard, is typically rich and opulent, packed with spice and ripe fruits. It is full-bodied, and at this young stage still dominated by toast and wood flavors.",40.00,Rhône_Valley,Marsanne
"Lovely soft, easy fruit, show up the fresh, fragrant style of Condrieu, despite coming from the hot 2003 vintage. Spice and wood show through the flavors of apricots and honey, leaving a smooth, oily texture to finish. This would be great with Asian food.",45.00,Rhône_Valley,Viognier
"This wine doesn't reveal that much of itself on the nose, showing just teasing hints of leather and cherries. But it oozes across the palate with dense, chocolate fudge flavors that carry cherry and dried spice notes. Rich and supple in the mouth, it finishes long and nuanced. Drink now-2010+.",37.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Named in homage to its founder, Gambert de Loche, this is one of the top wines from the Tain cooperative. It is young in color, with fresh fruit and solid tannins. The flavors of cranberries and blackcurrants just emphasize the dryness of the wine. A serious wine that will develop well over 5-10 years.",50.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"This is a blend from three of the top Hermitage vineyards - L'Ermite, le Sabot and Les Bessards. It is powerful and rich, with black fruits, spices and leather aromas. To taste, there are barnyard flavors, acidity and dense tannins. It will certainly age, probably over 10 years.",71.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"This is old-style winemaking, but in the best sense. It is big, dominated at this stage by tannins. The fruit is dark, brooding and intense. It has layers of wood (of which 20 percent was new), while the acidity still needs to soften out. This will age, maybe 10-12 years.",88.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Not a blockbuster, but a medium-weight Riesling that should age almost indefinitely on its taut spine of acidity. Smoke and mineral aromas add complexity to bold, peach-accented apples and a broad streak of lime.",96.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Fontenille is almost always a great value, and this 2000 is no exception, boasting concentrated raspberry aromas that leap from the glass. The intense fruit is nicely balanced by structure, and made complex by the addition of leather and dark chocolate notes on the lengthy finish. Drink now-2010.",13.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A serious style, big with tannins and dry fruit, this is still packed with perfumed Syrah flavors. It has a dark, brooding structure, with acidity, and pure fruits. This is the pair to the more exuberant L'Amarybelle.",58.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"A ripe, spicy wood flavored wine, with tastes of fresh peaches and apricots. It is rich, with a balance that has come together well. This is 100 percent Marsanne, and that shows in the wine's full-body and dried fruit and spice. A great performance from the Tain cooperative.",35.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"Great ripe fruit is just beginning to show through this huge, dense wine. It's big, and dark and, obviously still very young. But it is going to develop into a fine, solid dark wine which will age over many years. Buy now, start to enjoy in 5 years.",52.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"This is the label under which Château La Rame —a sweet wine producer in Saint Croix du Mont—commercializes its dry white, made from Sauvignon Blanc. No, it is not a profound wine, but it should be an example to other producers of humble Bordeaux blanc of what can be achieved through care and dedication. It's concentrated and intense, with a rich mouthfeel and bold grapefruit flavors that linger a long time on the finish.",10.00,Bordeaux,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A rich, full-bodied style of wine, which has some caramel flavors as well as white peach flavors. Jacquart is a great value brand from one of the big cooperatives, and this style is immediately attractive and easy. Imported by Tri-Vin Imports.",35.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"One of a number of brands owned by the Union Champagne cooperative, this Champagne is an easy drinking wine, with good acidity and attractive freshness. It is not a wine for bottle aging, but its good price makes it a great buy. Imported by De Saint Gall.",35.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"The cooperative that makes Nicolas Feuillatte is doing good things with this brand. This Réserve Particulière is elegantly made, with fine white fruit flavors along with a touch of toast. It is light, poised and makes a good apéritif. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",28.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"A full, creamy Champagne that has ripe fruits and dry but rich character that lends itself ideally to food, even to meat dishes. This is a wine with weight and some intense fruity power. Imported by Moët Hennessy USA.",70.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Condrieu also comes in a rarer, sweet style, and here it is, in a wine that is both opulent and exotic. This cuvée de prestige is sweet, certainly, but it has layers of dry botrytis which give it balance. There's also acidity to give the wine a final lift.",80.00,Rhône_Valley,Viognier
"This is Cuilleron's top Condrieu, a voluptuous style of wine which is spiced with new wood and packed with flavors of honey, of treacle and white peaches. There is acidity, but it only plays a walk-on part in this big, fat wine.",85.00,Rhône_Valley,Viognier
"This wine appears to be in a somewhat dormant phase, only stubbornly revealing hints of violets and bacon on the nose. Fortunately, you can taste the potential in its blackberry and cured meat flavors and long, mouthwatering finish. Drink 2008-2015.",71.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Guigal's blended Saint-Joseph delivers loads of Syrah flavor—from hints of bacon and black olive to coffee, earth and blackberries. It's medium in body, with supple tannins and a lingering, blackberry-filled finish. Drink now–2010.",28.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Floral and violetty on the nose, blending smoothly into vibrant blackberry notes. It's relatively light-bodied, with a Burgundian weight and mouthfeel that make it seem alternately fragile and elegant. Drink over the next year or two.",12.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Dark and roasted on the nose, with aromas of soy, chocolate and a caramelized aspect to the fruit. Flavors are similar, edging toward flambéed cherries, cinnamon and chocolate buoyed by a supple mouthfeel. Finishes with soft tannins and good length. Drink now-2010, perhaps longer.",35.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"From a single parcel, situated just south of Condrieu, this wine takes its name from the fact the vineyard has an almost vertical slope, with a full south exposure. Full of exotic perfumes, it is ripe, with exotic fruits, a taste of violets and light acidity.",109.00,Rhône_Valley,Viognier
"Oily in texture and a trifle sweet, this luscious wine coats the palate with flavors of very ripe grapefruit and lychee. Aromas are more restrained, showing pear and melon, while it finishes long, with echoes of spice.",32.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"With fruit coming from the Saint-Epine vineyard, this wine comes from the heart of the Saint-Joseph appellation. There is plenty of rich fruit, generous and packed with black plums and sweet jelly fruits. There is acidity and a streak of spicy wood which provides great balance.",53.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Hugely perfumed pure Syrah and flavors of blackcurrants and smoky wood - this is a power-packed wine, which shows a great purity of fruit. It has solid, dark tannins as well, which suggest it should age well over 5-10 years.",32.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Boasts some interesting aromas of clove and black pepper, balanced by blackberry and cherry flavors. Nicely proportioned and well structured, with mild tannins and decent acidity; it's not a blockbuster—just a satisfying accompaniment to simply prepared red meats. With a butterflied leg of lamb off the grill, no one will guess you're serving a $10 wine.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Why does nobody think about dry white Bordeaux? Blended from Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon, it is a delicious white wine bargain. And Château Bonnet is one of the best examples. Made in the Entre-deux-Mers region by André Lurton, whose family seems to own or manage half of Bordeaux, it is full of flavors of orange and apricot with a touch of grapefruit to provide the freshness. There is a light toast character to round it off.",11.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_White_Blend
"Morey is better known for white wines, but this villages-level red is no slouch. It's silky and medium-bodied, with baking spices layered over plum and cherry fruit. Turns a bit cedary on the finish, where tea-like tannins grab hold.",33.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"This is tough as nails right now, but also packed with almost liqueur-like black cherry fruit. Meaty nuances and chocolate-fudge richness are stopped abruptly by firm, astringent tannins on the finish. It's too tannic to enjoy now; the question is whether it will resemble one of the great '47 red Burgundies with age, or dry out like some of the '76s.",167.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A rich, lush melange of fruit and nuts, with sinuous, almost unctuous flavors that twine around the palate like a snake. Long, fascinating finish, elegantly balanced and precise.",55.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Exemplary in all areas, from the smoke, mushroom and berry nose to the exotic undertones of island spice and fine oak supporting vibrant raspberry fruit. It's one of those wines that's a pure pleasure to drink, and it's ready out of the gate. For very good Burgundy that clicks on all cylinders, this is it.",33.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Fruity and fresh, this wine is as packed with grapes and cherries as a wine can be, yet still picks up hints of plum and chocolate on the finish, imparting added complexity. Duboeuf, the largest producer of Beaujolais, seems to have struck gold in this vintage; if you can't find this Morgon, try one of the other crus. And look for the domaine wines Duboeuf commercializes when they are released.",12.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"Jean Chanfreau's family, which owns Châteaux Fonréaud and Lestage in Listrac, produces this blend of 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 45% Merlot and 3% Petit Verdot, giving a wine with plenty of Cabernet cassis flavors, but also a roundness and spiciness that sit well with firm tannins. Lovers of young Bordeaux will find it ready to drink now, but it has a good five years before complete maturity.",17.00,Bordeaux,Red_Blend
"Brun packs a lot of complexity into this wine. Briary, stemmy aromas add a wild touch to the crystalline black fruit, and those same elements re-emerge on the long finish. Crisp and clean, and with enough weight that it's hard to believe the label's stated 11% alcohol.",13.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"Guy Ricard of Domaine le Couroulu believes his 2000 vintage made wines that will “appeal very quickly.” While his main production is of Vacqueyras, where his cellar is located, he also has vineyards in the Côtes du Rhône appellation. This wine confirms his prediction about 2000: It is ripe, with perfumed aromas and raspberry flavors. Sweet, soft tannins and concentrated fruit make it a great value.",10.00,Rhône_Valley,Red_Blend
"Starts off a little rocky, with rubbery, reductive notes that give way to flavors of ripe pears and melons, accented by dried spices. Medium-bodied and dry, with a slightly oily texture and a spicy, persistent finish. A natural with trout or salmon.",86.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"From a large producer, this prestige cuvée was a pleasant surprise, with lovely aromas of dried flowers, leather and cherries and a creamy, supple mouthfeel. Finishes long and softly tannic. Doesn't seem to have the stuffing to make old bones, so drink it now–2010.",28.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This full-bodied white boasts layers of mouthfilling pears, melons and dried spices, and it finishes long. With its richness it would be a fine accompaniment to cream-sauced fish or chicken dishes.",10.00,Rhône_Valley,White_Blend
"Severe and austere at this stage, this solid, dark wine has all the weight of a wine from Gevrey, concentrated and densely tannic. It's firm, packed with dark plum fruit and perfumed acidity. It's foursquare, demanding long aging. Drink from 2021",135.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Produced from organically grown grapes, this structured wine is complex and still very closed up, with dense tannins and dark fruit. Powerful with dark plum flavors, it is firmly textured and needs plenty of time for aging. Drink from 2020",200.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Ethereal notes of orange blossom and jasmine lead to richer tones of damask rose underpinned by a lively orange-peel freshness. The palate presents the same delicious juxtaposition of opulence and light-footed ease. Full of life and fragrant, vigorous joy, the wine has flavors that seem to linger forever.",80.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"This Beaune bottling has a dense structure that broods through its tannic outer skin. Perfumed red fruits will shortly burst out to give an opulent, rich wine with both great acidity and layers of spice that finish with freshness. Drink from 2021.",93.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Wonderful spice and ripe red fruits shoot through this rich while structured wine. Dark cherries, strawberries and a ripe texture have given a wine that will be beautiful, smooth and generous. The acidity and the core of tannins will allow it to age well. Drink from 2019.",62.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"The full force of aromatic, dried pear rises from the glass, laced with dried apricot and candied peel. The pear fruit becomes exquisitely clear and pure on the palate, which is profound but slender. The wine is dry but powerful, holding at its core all the ripeness and fruit flavor from brilliant sunlight. It almost warms you from inside and goes on and on. Drink now till 2030.",80.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"Ferraton is partly owned by Chapoutier, and affect to call their Crozes-Hermitage and Hermitage by the older spelling of Ermitage. But the important thing is the wine, and this Crozes is deliciously accessible with good acidity and some dry, but juicy fruit. The tannins and the wood play a good balancing role.",23.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Smoky and slightly bacony on the nose, but also quite cedary. The lavish oak is even more apparent in the mouth, where cedar and vanilla flavors take charge. It's supple, easy to drink and a very enjoyable wine, but the Cote-Rotie distinctiveness needs time to emerge. Try in 2008.",110.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Cuilleron's use of wood is subtle, leaving just a hint of caramel on this smooth, opulent wine. It is rich, fat and full-bodied, with flavors more of apricots and white fruits. There's a light touch of acidity, but spices and ripe fruits dominate.",44.00,Rhône_Valley,Marsanne
"A bit cloudy in appearance, this richly textured, plump wine boasts rich aromas of ripe pears and dried spices alongside notes of lemon curd. Custardy on the palate, folding in hints of pear, citrus and minerals. The only quibble is that it finishes a little short. Drink now.",14.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"With its slightly oily and sweet flavors of honeyed pears and melons, this speaks plainly of late-picked Pinot Gris. Finishes on the short side, but there's no doubt that it's clean and varietally correct.",46.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"This wine proclaims itself with forward and nicely integrated aromas of black currants, lavender and toasty oak. The wine displays a great deal of finesse, and the mouthfeel is velvety and rich, with dried cherry and anise flavors that extend through the spicy, long and even finish. A very impressive red with some tannins to lose, this is one Minervois that's capable—and worthy—of aging.",35.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Shiraz
"Here's a Gewurztraminer that's slightly viscous in the mouth, plump but not heavy, with a mouthwatering, refreshing finish. Pear and melon aromas lead into textbook lychee flavors.",32.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"The Cave of Tain l'Hermitage is, through its cooperative members, the biggest owner in Hermitage. It certainly is able to produce a dense, dusty tannic wine, which has fine black fruits. The wine is rich, and dark, with acidity. It seems to be developing fast, and should last over the next 5-10 years.",35.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"A borad-shouldered and extracted wine, it also has some hard edges that demand cellaring. Herbal and cherry scents mix with darker, plummier notes on the nose, while the palate folds in earthy nuances. The one concern is that the alcohol level comes through a bit on the finish.",34.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This lightly sweet VT goes down deceptively easily, blending ripe citrus and pear flavors with hints of clove and allspice. A hint of shoe polish detracts slightly from the nose, but the wine finishes soft and without any hint of bitterness.",41.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"Not that effusive on the nose, but the flavors sing on the palate, revealing black cherry, earth and coffee flavors carried along on a supple, velvety mouthfeel. The fruit really comes through on the finish. Drink now, or anytime before 2012.",16.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"For lovers of Syrah, Cornas is the purest expression, with its dark, brooding tannins and heady fruit. This wine, from the Tain cooperative, is a classic Cornas, which just misses the intensity of some examples, but still has fine, dry tannins and long-lasting acidity.",25.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"The biggest of the Latour Meursaults, with extra layers of ripe fruit and nuances of toast and nuts extending into a textured, lengthy finish. Focused and elegant.",55.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This is a large-scaled, structured Riesling that's loaded with minerals, boasting just hints of peach and apple. Starts with lime aromas but goes down like liquid rocks, capped of by a lingering, minerally finish. Nice wine, just not one full of fruit.",21.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Scents of dried apricots and candied citrus leap from the glass, followed by flavors of honey, pear and melon. This is slightly sweet, with a robust 13% alcohol that gives it heft on the palate. Try with rich appetizers or with the cheese course.",41.00,Alsace,Riesling
"A spicy, earthy wine, with ripe tannins and generous fruit. It is tannic, with dry spice and cranberry flavors, with acidity. This wine comes from Jean-Luc Colombo's family property near Aix-en-Provence. It will work well with spicy Mediterranean food flavors.",20.00,Provence,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"One of the best Sylvaner's we've tried, this shows surprising richness and depth for the variety. Smells like honeyed bergamot, tastes like melons and pears, finishes with a refreshing, citrusy tang. Drink now.",14.00,Alsace,Silvaner
"Unlike this firm's minerally, muscular Rieslings, this Pinot Gris shows plenty of forward fruit, ranging from honey to tangerines to melon. Viscous and slightly off-dry, with a long, peppery finish. Drink now.",23.00,Alsace,Tokay_Pinot_Gris
"A ripe, full-bodied Crozes, with herbal aromas, and great smoky, leathery flavors. Red fruits add to the mix, which also shows some barnyard characters which don't offend and certainly add complexity. This is a well-made, good value wine. Drink now, and over 5 years.",30.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Scents of buttered popcorn lead the way, followed by waves of oak-derived flavors: cedar, vanilla and chocolate, backed up by some black cherry notes. The mouthfeel is supple and creamy, the finish moderately tannic. Drink this lavishly oaked wine from 2007-2015, once the wood has integrated a little better with its fruit substrate.",30.00,Rhône_Valley,Red_Blend
"Starts with smoky, leathery aromas, then moves on to scents of sun-baked stones. Mouthfilling dark, brandied cherries follow, finishing with a spike of acidity and firm tannins. Drink this full-bodied wine from 2007–2015.",34.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"There is perfumed fruit, with aromas of red currants. This wine, named after the granite soil which forms the base of Saint-Joseph, is earthy, ripe and firmly tannic, but with plenty of red fruit flavors. It should develop quickly, over the next 2-3 years.",18.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Stumbles a little coming out of the gate, revealing hints of shoe polish and burnt rubber, but gathers itself midpalate with intense flavors of muskmelon and orange marmalade and finishes strong, ending on a hint of Earl Grey tea.",38.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"A decent value for red Burgundy, with supple tannins that frame cherry and vanilla flavors. A sinewy thread of fresh herbs runs throughout, ending in hints of dark chocolate on the finish. Drink now–2010.",19.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"There's a funky, waxy edge to this wine that adds complexity to its honeyed melon, lime and pear aromas and flavors. It's quite full-bodied, and carries a bit of residual sugar as well, making it a prime candidate to match with mild curries and the like.",30.00,Alsace,Tokay_Pinot_Gris
"Very firm and tight, with streaks of mineral and textures of earth. Unyielding and a bit over-sulfered, but it hints and depth and concentration.",48.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Crisp, with grapefruit aromas and flavors, this is textbook Loire Sauvignon Blanc. A mild smoky, mineral note adds complexity, and the full fruit is clean and ripe, yet not at all sweet. Pulls it all off with lots of class and style. This is still the model the New Zealanders are using in their Sauvignon Blanc efforts.",20.00,Loire_Valley,White_Blend
"The proverbial Burgundian barnyard is on display here. Horsehide and hay are detectable, but are by no means bad or overbearing. The palate is deep and very solid. It's more country-style than refined, which makes it well suited to casual drinking. Will benefit from a couple of years of bottle age.",22.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Richly scented with citrus blossoms, mineral and spice. Nicely balanced and light, the flavors are layered and intermingled through an elegant, firm, satisfying finish.",45.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A number of intense aromas and flavors make this Rhône-varietal white very appealing. Ripe apple, melon, honey and anise aromatics open to a full palate of melon, white peach and spice flavors. Fruit-driven, but with great balance, a nice chalky feel, and considerable depth and intensity.",17.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,White_Blend
"Scents of pineapple and hazelnuts open into a lush, spicy, forward, slightly toasty wine with immediate drinkablility and appeal.",40.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
Smoky and minerally on the nose--like when you strike two pieces of flint together. But there are also ripe fruit flavors of honey and pink grapefruit and a richness of texture that's usually lacking in Petit Chablis. Such a vivid expression of minerality is hard to find at this price.,13.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A bit severe for present consumption, this is a lean, stony wine, enlivened by hints of green apple and lime. It's crisp and clean, making it possible to drink now, but its austerity suggests patience; try in 2010, when its angular minerals might be softened somewhat.",35.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Starts off with pretty pear, apple and honey scents, then moves into flavors of green apple, citrus and crushed stones. It's medium-bodied, plump without being too soft, with a crisp finish.",28.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"An earthy wine, which has flavors of walnuts and spice, with a hint of ripe fruits, but more of herbs. At this stage, the wine hasn't yet struck a balance between the wood and other flavors.",36.00,Rhône_Valley,Marsanne
"True to the vintage (a hot one), this is a big, fat Châteauneuf, with exotic aromas of apple blossoms and nectarines. Stones fruits and pears caress the palate, brought into focus by a touch of green apple on the finish.",29.00,Rhône_Valley,White_Blend
"With its dry, dusty mouthfeel and moderate tannins, this wine clearly calls for some cellaring, but the ingredients for a successful evolution are there: balanced measures of tannins, alcohol, fruit and acidity. Leather, dried frruit and chocolate notes lead the way, followed by ripe black cherries and a hint of anise on the finish. Drink 2007–2012.",16.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"From its aromas of black pepper and cured meats, this wine screams Syrah. Of course, it tastes like syrah too, yielding flavors of blackberries, black pepper and air-dried beef. A bit leaner and less generous on the palate than Guigal's Saint-Joseph, but still an impressive effort, with a firm  structure and modest tannins on the finish. Drink 2006–2012.",20.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"This is a ripe wine that accurately reflects the heat of the 2003 summer. Apple, peach and honey aromas and flavors and a big, slightly oily mouthfeel overwhelm any mineral elements--at least now, in its boisterous, fun youth.",15.00,Alsace,Riesling
"There's a lifted, herbal element to this wine's aromas of cherries and dusty earth, but it serves to add complexity, not detract from the fruit. In the mouth, the flavors include hints of pepper and meat alongside oodles of ripe cherries. It's all balanced and harmonious even if it's not a blockbuster. A fine effort from a difficult vintage.",13.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Shows plenty of ripe apple and citrus fruit on the nose, then adds a bit of diesel fuel to the mix on the palate. Medium in body, with a crisp, lime-laden finish that's more focused and refreshing than Sparr's regular Riesling bottling.",16.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Shows the torrid vintage character in its aromas of chocolate fudge and flavors of dark plum and chocolate, but doesn't go off into raisins or prunes. Finishes with coffee and dry toast notes that should eventually integrate. It's a big, bulky, tannic wine that might improve over time.",22.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"The wines of Faiveley avoid the raisiny notes found in many 2003 red Burgundies. This wine shows plenty of ripe Pinot character—dark cherries. plums and chocolate—but also astringent tannins that give it a tough exterior. If these integrate better with time, this rating may look conservative, but there's no guarantee here.",53.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"From the Côte de Rouffach area, this is a wine that's eminently alive. Apricot, nectarine and mango comprise the all-fruit nose and palate. All in all, it's like a peachy parfait. If you dig deep you'll find some of those custard, stone and petrol nuances that give Alsace Rieslings their character.",19.00,Alsace,Riesling
"With 60% Grenache, 35% Syrah and a bit of Mourvèdre, this very smooth red is constructed like a mini Châteauneuf-du-Pape. The fruit is presently a bit suppressed, and the wine appears to be in a closed phase right now, but it is still very elegant.",19.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"There's a youthful and dominant smashed-berry element to the bouquet. A little bit of citrus rind and nutmeg add nuance to an otherwise full-blast and friendly southern Rhône quaffer. Has balance, style and a woody finish. Best Buy.",9.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"An intense nose of toasted walnuts and vanilla is balanced by a palate full of tart pear and lemon fruit. The citrusy finish lingers, picking up smoke and spice notes that turn slightly drying. Try in 2002.",46.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A round and attractive white wine with slightly musky pear and sweet hay aromas that open to melon and mild peach flavors. The pear element returns along with a slight spicy note on the clean finish, which shows good length.",19.00,Alsace,Tokay_Pinot_Gris
"Lovely Grenache aromas of orange peel and nutmeg open up this tasty country-style wine. Cherry and strawberry flavors display a touch of rusticity, but not too much: It's mostly about clear and clean fruit expression, and it finishes light and airy. An excellent choice for patio dining or with lunch.",13.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Right away it strikes a fairly harmonious chord—it's fresh smelling, with good weight in the mouth. Nice lemon and grapefruit flavors carry a pithy edge, and there's plenty of length to the finish. The steely backpalate is where you get the acidity. As a whole, it's food-friendly and it shouldn't disappoint.",24.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Heavy on the earth and leather, but it's all backed up nicely by clove-spiced black cherries and a lush, velvety mouthfeel. Turns a little tart and tannic on the finish, but just enough to let it age comfortably for a few years.",43.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"An attractive wine that might be called “upscale rustic,” with its earthy plum, mineral and leather aromas and flavors. Full and tangy on the palate, it is already a great match for hearty food, and can be cellared as well, for two to five years.",12.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Tart, citrusy fruit, with blossoms and zest and juice all blended into a medium-bodied wine. The finish opens out with some nice toast and vanilla cream. Round and full.",34.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Features honeyed, overripe melons that carry only a hint of botrytis. Quite sweet and rich, it's forward, showing plenty of charm while lacking the depth and backbone to improve. Drink now.",41.00,Alsace,Tokay_Pinot_Gris
"Light floral and sweet herb aromas open to a mouthful of grapefruit and mineral flavors in this clean, crisp but not sharp white. The finish is tangy and bright, with stony notes. All in all an enjoyable and refreshing light Chardonnay, with some complexity and style.",12.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Opens with mild petrol and light apricot aromas, layered with butter. But before you discard it as over-the-top, notice the fine acids and long soda-cracker finish. It does well with food and leaves a positive overall impression.",15.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Viognier
"A ripe, spicy wine flavored with spicy wood, honey and apricots, favoring elegance rather than opulence. It comes from a slope outside the village of Chavanay in the heart of Condrieu.",58.00,Rhône_Valley,Viognier
"Starts with scents of almond and unripe nectarine, then slowly unfurls to reveal flavors of honey and peach. A hint of sweetness makes this easier to drink now, but this cuvee could still use another few years of cellaring to give up the goods.",23.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"Adds an extra level of richness compared to Sparr's regular Pinot Gris, but the flavors are similar: poached pears and ripe melons tinged with honey and pineapple. A smooth, harmonious expression of Pinot Gris that won't set you back a fortune.",17.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"An easy-drinking syrah from the northern Rhône, this medium-weight wine boasts aromas of horse sweat, black pepper and roasted cherries, backed by flavors of black cherries and dried spices. It's plump and juicy. with a mouthwatering finish. Drink now–2010.",27.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Off-dry and richly concentrated, without being over the top. Restrained lychee fruit flavors blend with another note that's reminiscent of corn oil. Finishes with decent length and a touch of spice.",23.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"Textbook Gewurztraminer, done well, starting with scents of rose petals and lychees, and moving through pear and melon flavors into a finish that shows a hint of bitterness. Medium-weight and just slightly off-dry.",16.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"This Côtes-du-Rhône blanc features pear and honeydew melon aromas that lead into similar flavors, with a touch of apple thrown into the mix. It's full-bodied but balanced by fresh acidity, finishing with hints of citrus and minerals.",11.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"This is a broad, mouthfilling Gewurz, one that leans heavily on spice to make its statement. Not a flowery, fruity model, but one that emphasizes cinnamon, clove and allspice, leavened by a helping of citrus. Finishes with a hint of orange peel.",17.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"Typical Loire aromas of grass, wet stone and grapefruit are marred a bit by sulfur, which could liberally be read as minerals. On the palate, it's lean and trim, yet lively. A light chalky sensation on the back end adds texture.",23.00,Loire_Valley,White_Blend
"This wine shows an effusive nose of cinnamon, red berries and banana. Tangy, with moderate to high acidity, and a light, but not insubstantial mouthfeel. The juicy red-fruit flavors are offset by a touch of complexity in the form of a mild tarry note. Finishes dry, with brisk tannins, and should improve over the next 12 to 18 months.",14.00,Beaujolais,Red_Blend
"Dark red fruits, tar and licorice mark the nose. The full red-fruit flavors are solid and the good acidity,  typical of Gamay-based wines, lets them show well. A solid and balanced everyday drinker, it closes with dry, dusty tannins and proves that more than cru Beaujolais can have meat on their bones.",11.00,Beaujolais,Gamay
"A Merlot-Cabernet blend that starts out a little awkward and then really finds its legs. This is a perfect “beginner's” Bordeaux, in that it's fruity, clean and precise. The lack of complexity and high-end nuances doesn't hurt it at all. A little overoaked, but with airing out it tastes quite good. And it has the stuffing to match with hearty foods. Best Buy.",10.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Redolent with aromas of pears, strawberries and kirsch, this is a tasty, forward wine that's more charming than sturdy. Less concentrated than you might expect for the appellation, this should be drunk up quickly for its simply delicious fruit.",12.00,Beaujolais,Red_Blend
"Soft and citrusy, with streaks of lime and mineral and a surprisingly long, Burgundian finish. Clean and steely, with no trace of oak. The fine ripe fruit speaks volumes. Best Buy.",10.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Fresh, tight and properly crisp, there’s nothing here to put it in the California-blowsy category. Stone-fruit aromas lead into peach and green-apple flavors. Not much depth, but plenty of refreshing fruit and palate-cleansing verve. Best Buy.",11.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Is it the lucid rosy color or the exotic flavor that invokes images of a well-made cup of tea? In this unusual rendering of the world's most idiosyncratic grape, it's both. Floral, light, even dainty, it tastes of strawberries, cream and a little woody spice. For an airy, light-bodied Pinot, this one scores points for expression. The finish is lovely.",19.00,Alsace,Pinot_Noir
"A sharp, almost flinty wine, with firm, tart fruit and a tight finish.",20.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Pleasant, pale, fairly thin and tart, with lemony fruit and a simple finish.",16.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"A straightforward white with a medium to full mouthfeel. Melon, hay and mineral aromas and flavors predominate. Tastes and feels mature now, and finishes dry, with a mineral-stony note.",11.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"Meaty and full of black-fruit aromas. Offers clearly definable Syrah flavor, but there's not much depth to the chunky fruit. Best from a carafe at your favorite bistro.",10.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Syrah
From a warm area of France—the hefty body and overt sweetness virtually announce “Pays d'Oc white.” Melon and lemon notes spread across the chewy palate. A heavy dose of candy-store sugar is partially balanced by a brisk tang on the finish.,9.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Chardonnay
"Surprisingly dry and steely for a 2003, with lime and green apples married to hints of almond and peach. Crisp acids and a dry, clean finish.",16.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"Smells leathery and a bit overripe, with scents of dried fruit outweighing freshness. The leather and dried-cherry flavors linger enticingly on the finish, but show a trace of alcoholic warmth as well. A solid wine, but a disappointing effort from the Rhône's most famous and reliable négociant.",45.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"The southernmost appellation in the northern Rhône produces a light, fresh style of white wine which can also comes in a sparkling version. This wine, from Tain cooperative, is typically light and fresh with a touch of almonds and green fruits. Great with fish dishes.",13.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"A ripe, soft wine, which has a pleasant touch of spicy wood. It is fat and full-bodied, with flavors of apricots and honey. Perhaps not as focused as Condrieu from a cooler vintage than 2003, it is likely to develop over 4-5 years.",50.00,Rhône_Valley,Viognier
"This full-bodied Pinot Blanc is ripe and soft, boasting lots of round, melony fruit. Likeable and zaftig, but lacking nuance. Drink now.",12.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"A crisp, fresh Riesling that manages to be lean without being mean, cushioning its racy acids with just enough lime and green apple fruit flavors.",34.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Begins with ultraripe scents of melon and honey, and doesn't change much from start to finish. It's a plump, fairly weighty offering, low in acid, that leaves the mouth coated with flavor. Simple but satisfying.",12.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"Dominated by wood from start to finish, from scents of vanilla, toast and dried spices, to flavors of cinnamon-dusted toast and a dry, cedary finish. There's enough fruit to support the wood, but not to shine through.",80.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A bit tarry and reductive, but the underlying fruit seems sound, with cherry flavors buttressed by a plump, velvety texture. Hints of coffee and chocolate creep in on the finish.",22.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A bit herbal on the nose, but unlike some 2003s, it retains a sense of freshness, avoiding any baked character. It's crisp and tart in the mouth, too, with snappy cherry flavors that carry a fair amount of tannic grip. Maybe a bit too stern, but structure is part of the house style at Faiveley.",17.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"A fresh, lightly tannic wine, with acidity, flavors of red fruits. The dry tannins are ripe and easy, with good wood flavors. It is approachable, without great complexity - a great example of this inexpensive appellation.",11.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"A full, but attractive wine, with flavors of almonds, peaches and soft white fruits. It is quite fat, and lacks acidity, an effect of the hot 2003 vintage, giving a southern, herbal feel. It would work well with fish or strong cheeses.",30.00,Rhône_Valley,Marsanne
"This blended white combines fresh apple and pear fruit notes with minerally, petrolly nuances to give a surprisingly complex result. Finshes with a burst of lime. Drink now and over the next several months; this isn't built to age.",11.00,Alsace,White_Blend
"A nice, easy-drinking Côtes-du-Rhône, with dark plum and blackberry aromas and flavors and hints of smoke and anise. It's neither too big nor too light--if Goldilocks were a wine-drinker, she'd say the weight on the palate is just right.",25.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This nondescript Marsanne boasts waxy, paraffin-like aromas alongside hints of lemon rind and smoke. Opens up to reveal some melon and citrus on the palate before finishing with hints of anise and beeswax. Might develop in time, might not.",28.00,Rhône_Valley,Marsanne
"Hints of cinnamon and clove reflect a small amount of new oak aging, but the dominant flavors are of plum and dusty earth. Not a powerhouse, it's a balanced, food-friendly wine at a reasonable price‹the kind of wine that wins friends, not ratings competitions.",13.00,Rhône_Valley,Red_Blend
"Pear, honey and pineapple notes on the nose give way to more melony flavors on the palate. Mouthfeel is slightly oily, leaving behind the suggestion of quince and honey on the finish. Not complex, but mouthfilling and well balanced.",15.00,Alsace,Pinot_Gris
"Seems a little sour and earthy at first, but it just needs some time in the glass to come around. It's a reasonably plump Riesling, with lemon custard and lemon rind flavors and a lingering finish. Easy to drink.",14.00,Alsace,Riesling
"There's a bit of rose petal on the nose, but this Gewurz tilts more to the lychee side of the taste spectrum, with spiced pears adding to the mix. Balanced and soft, with a gentle finish that fades a little too quickly.",23.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"This blend of 50% Grenache blanc, 40% Viognier and 10% Marsanne reveals an interesting blend of fruit and wood. Toasty, mealy notes on the nose fight a little with floral, anise scents, while the flavors combine lemon and clove. Medium-weight, with crisp acids and a citrusy finish.",14.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"As the name suggests, this would be a solid option with shellfish. Green apple and pear scents carry just a whiff of honey, while the body is light and the flavors spare and minerally, finishing with a touch of grapefruit.",11.00,Alsace,White_Blend
"Shows some cedary oak on the nose, then slightly Port-like, raisin and chocolate flavors emblematic of the vintage. It's chunky and full in the mouth, finishing with dusty notes and a hint of bacon fat.",38.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Starts off well, blending aromas of smoke, mineral and diesel with lime and pineapple, then delivers tropical and citrus fruits on the palate. Stumbles at the finish, which is short and not as impressively concentrated as some of Albrecht's other bottlings.",86.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Seems a little disjointed at this stage of its development, with components that don't seem completely integrated: caramel, cherries, pepper and dusty earth notes. Supple mouthfeel bodes well, and if the pieces here come together, this rating may look stingy five years from now.",30.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Has all the things you expect from a Rhône blend--bits of leather and horse, black cherries, plums and coffee--pretty standard stuff. What gives this wine a leg up is its smooth, suppple mouthfeel and easy drinkability.",12.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A solid burger red, with just enough tannin on the finish to stand up to grilled ground beef. Flavors are straightforward and pleasing, with touches of black cherries and white pepper. Drink now–2007.",8.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Reductive and faintly smelling of merde at first, this seems to lessen with aeration to reveal modest cherry fruit carried along on a rather pinched and lean palate. Dusty tannins on the finish suggest another year or two of cellaring might help, although it will never be charming.",29.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Roasted and pruny on the nose, followed by a flacid wine with soft tannins but little acidity. Dull, with some cocoa on the finish.",15.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Youthfully exuberant and filled with fruit, but also a bit tannic and drying on the finish. Leathery fruit seems a bit overdone, and there's a hint of volatility as well. tough call, and this may well settle down and be better than it is now given a couple of years in the cellar.",16.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Quite respectable for the 2002 vintage (a difficult one), Delas has turned out a crisp wine, filled with tart cherry fruit and a helping of characterful stable-y notes.",13.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Despite the name, this is a blend of five of Alsace's white varieties: Riesling, Pinot Blanc, Gewurztraminer, Muscat and Pinot Gris. The result is a simple sipper destined for the aperitif course or perhaps a casual picnic. Pear and melon flavors finish with a spicy, grapefruity edge.",12.00,Alsace,White_Blend
"Modest cherry and herbal-stemmy aromas give way to lean cherry flavors on the palate. It seems a little dilute and underripe, which could be a result of the vintage. Decent, but leaves one wishing for more power.",19.00,Rhône_Valley,Syrah
"Firmly in the house style, this Gewurz is restrained and minerally rather than dramatically flamboyant. Ripe melon and pear flavors are delivered in a medium-bodied format, finishing a bit short.",20.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"Undoubtedly an ambitious effort, Albrecht's Amplus is an impressively extracted Pinot that ends up coming across as too woody and too tannic for its modest cherry fruit. Lots of vanilla, cedar and caramel if you like that sort of thing.",44.00,Alsace,Pinot_Noir
"This clean, neutral white wine features modest aromas of apples and limes, a plump mouthfeel and a stony, citrusy finish. Try it with fish stew, sometime during the next several months.",8.00,Rhône_Valley,White_Blend
"This fat, slightly alcoholic white shows the warmth of the vintage, with scents of pears tinged with beeswax and honey suggestive of very ripe fruit. Yet there's enough stony, minerally flavors to redeem it.",8.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_White_Blend
"Gorgeous, concentrated, ripe fruit show both the quality of this wine and the extra warmth of 2005. The MD is the top cuvée from the Bourgeois vineyard. It's dense and ripe, with almost exotic fruit flavors, and finishes generous and fruity. Imported by Monsieur Touton Selection Ltd.",24.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"This full-bodied wine just lacks that bit of freshness that would've taken it to the next level. Stewed plums, black olives and espresso notes are rich and complex, ending on a long silky note. Drink now and over the next few years.",41.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"This is a bit plummy and stewed on the nose, but shows more life on the palate, where some chewy tannins provide backbone and richness. Powdered cinnamon and cocoa notes mark the long finish. Drink now–2018.",22.00,Rhône_Valley,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A soft wine with attractive fruitiness and lemon and lime flavors. Fresh and rounded, it shows its northern French origins with the tight acidity at the end.",51.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"This pleasantly perfumed wine has some acidity, jammy red fruits and soft tannins. It feels very rounded and smooth, with a structure that is totally integrated into the velvet texture. Drink from 2016.",141.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Rounded and ripe, it has tannins nicely embedded in the red plum and strawberry flavors. It's full-bodied and already showing a delicious, seductive side. Drink from 2016.",39.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Young and fruity, this is a wine without wood aging. The palate is full of bright red fruits, light tannins and an attractive acidity. The wine is ready to drink.",20.00,Provence,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Lucien and his son, Gilles, are two of the best technicians in Sancerre: Their wines always have great purity of fruit. But with Le Chêne (the oak tree), they also have a fine, delicious wine that bursts with almond, toast and ripe fruit, as well as exuberant citrus flavors. This is Sauvignon Blanc at its freshest. Imported by Rosenthal Wine Merchants.",29.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Not labeled as late-harvest, but this wine is noticeably sweet, rich and mouthcoating. Honey, baked apple and cinnamon flavors easily glide across the palate, buttressed by just enough acidity to keep it from becoming cloying. Might be best with foie gras or cheese. Drinkable now, but should age effortlessly.",95.00,Alsace,Alsace_white_blend
"Masson-Blondelet has produced a sumptuous wine from the softer soils of Pouilly. It is ripe and rich, showing good concentration of green and yellow fruits, along with fine supporting acidity. There's a great depth, and certainly good aging ability. Imported by Grape Expectations (CA).",18.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"This is one of two terroir-based wines from Masson-Blondelet, coming from very minerally soil. It is fresh, taut, tight and packed with poised fruit. The acidity, green fruit flavors and the structure all suggest a wine which will age well. Imported by Grape Expectations (CA).",18.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Almost New World in its intense fruit flavors, bursting with currants, gooseberries and lemons, this is a wine packed with delights. It should age well over three or four years, but can be enjoyed now for its exuberant fruit. Imported by Monsieur Touton Selection Ltd.",18.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"From old vines on the Figeat estate, this is a densely flavored wine, with layers of ripe lemons and green peas, along with pure, fresh fruits. It will be a great Pouilly-Fumé, but certainly needs to age, to allow its intense fruit to soften and gain complexity. Imported by Angeles Wine Agency.",28.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"There aren't many aristocratic estates in the largely peasant-based culture of Pouilly. But this is one, and it's old, dating back to 1396. The Estutt d'Assay family makes one wine, an estate wine: This 2004 has great elegance, not hugely rich, but with fine, pure fruit flavors that are already well balanced. There's roundness from the terroir of Tract-sur-Loire as well as a streak of fine acidity. Imported by Louis Latour Inc.",35.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Named after Alphonse Mellot's son, this beautifully crafted top cuvée is produced from old vines, yielding a full body with a touch of wood that doesn't mask the fresh acidity, just softens it. And still the fruit remains taut with fine, intense grapefruit flavors. Imported by Commonwealth Wine & Spirits Inc.",50.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A rich, creamy style of wine, which still keeps a steely undercurrent. The wine is beautifully fresh and firm, but smooth with flavors of green apples and some tannic structure. Mineral flavors firm out this delicious, complex wine. Imported by Vineyard Brands.",26.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"This Riesling has extra levels of intensity and energy that set it apart from the crowd. Explosive aromas of fresh limes and honey burst from the glass, followed by peach and citrus flavors that drip with ripeness without getting heavy or ponderous. Long and concentrated on the finish.",22.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Almost smoky in its mineral intensity, backed by sturdy apple, pear and spice shadings. This blend of Riesling, Pinot Gris and Gewürztraminer is off-dry and intense without being heavy or overbearing, easily marrying honey, bergamot and cinnamon flavors.",52.00,Alsace,White_Blend
"Dry Alsace Riesling this good at this price doesn't come along every day, so snap this one up while you can. Steely, minerally scents ally with ripe limes on the nose, then open up into richly layered waves of mineral, spice and green apple on the palate. Not rich or unctuous in texture, just nicely balanced from mineral start to long finish.",25.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Rather reined-in on the nose, this wine lacks Gewürz's over-the-top aromatics, instead showing restrained pear and spice scents. Combined with the wine's lack of residual sugar, this aspect of the wine will make it more versatile with food, as it pumps out apple, citrus and spice flavors that turn peppery on the finish.",31.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"A very minerally wine, with white flower aromas and grapefruit flavors. This is such pure Sauvignon, it's just a joy to taste the ripe fruits, the freshness and bubbling flavors. Imported by Angeles Wine Agency.",18.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"This is a great, intense, apples-and-cream style of wine. The acidity is certainly there, but the richness and the ripeness of the fruit dominate. With its concentration and freshness, this will be delicious to drink this summer, but will age for a couple more years. Imported by Weygandt-Metzler.",27.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"From old vines, this intensely flavored wine is deliciously ripe, a product of the hot summer of 2005, but retains the essential acidity and citrus flavors of good Sancerre. Packed with fruit now, it will soften, ripen and gain almond layers that will give it even more complexity. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",20.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Made from old vines, this ripe, intensely fruity wine has flavors of green plums and gooseberries to go with a firm, tight structure that promises a couple of years aging. Imported by Bayfield Importing Ltd.",17.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Although based in neighboring Menetou-Salon, the Pellé winery also has this small property in Sancerre. This is in the full, soft style of Montigny, where the vineyards are located. It has plenty of open, ripe and generous fruit, showing good acidity as well as ripe apples, sweet lemons and just a touch of minerality. Imported by Michael Skurnik Wines.",24.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"With two years of aging, this wine has developed delicious nutty aromas and flavors; they have tamed the great, crisp fruit that still underlies what is a complex, intense wine. There is good depth to the white fruits and the aromas of white spring flowers. Imported by David Milligan Selections.",25.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"There's great depth of flavor to this top wine from Michel Redde. There's also a fine balance of acidity, minerality and great citrus fruit flavors. This is a wellcrafted wine, with freshness and depth of flavor in equal measure. Imported by Kobrand.",25.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A round, very ripe wine with concentrated, exuberant fruit flavors that leap out of the glass. This is a delicious, attractive wine, but one that should also age well, softening and taming the fresh, fruity acidity. Imported by Kysela Père et Fils.",19.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"It's a crisp, minerally wine, with currants and grapefruit, but also good intense pea and herb flavors. At the moment, the delicious fresh fruit dominates; a fine, concentrated wine. Imported by Winebow.",20.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"This is Alsace Riesling that's truly dry, dominated by lime and mineral scents that add apple notes with aeration. It's assertive and muscular, with a long, crisp finish. Try with poultry or pork.",15.00,Alsace,Riesling
"This wine is packed with open, fresh, succulent fruit that zings in the mouth. There are flavors of green apple skins, lychees and tropical fruits that last and last. Delicious and fresh; a wine for this summer. Imported by Monsieur Touton Selection Ltd.",20.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"As befits the hot, sultry summer of 2003, this is a big, fat wine. It's also maturing well, showing a soft acidity as well as tropical fruits, lychees and some almond flavors. The structure is still there, with some fresh currants, giving crispness as well richness. Imported by David Milligan Selections.",25.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Another distinctive wine from Marcel Deiss, this one offers up piercing aromas of spice and lemon-scented furniture polish. Braced for piquancy, the palate instead receives an oily coating of sweet pear and pineapple flavors. Long on the finish, though it does show a touch of alcoholic warmth.",29.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"Named after the old word for Sauvignon Blanc, this is a fresh, still young wine, but one that already has complexity. Annick Tinel has produced a wine that has an herbal character as well as one which peels away layer after layer of concentrated fruit. Imported by Kysela Père et Fils.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A delicious, ripe and intensely fruity wine that is still young but will eventually be rich and concentrated. Packed with exotic fruits, mineral characters and sweet acidity, this is very attractive now, but does need to age 2–3 years. Imported by William Harrison Imports.",20.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"There's great fruit here, lots of white currants, crisp green apples and fresh pears. At the moment, it's all fruit, a result of the vintage and the fact that it's a young wine. But there will be more because the fruit is so concentrated it will give roundness and depth in a year or two. Imported by Monsieur Touton Selection Ltd.",18.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Produced by Domaine Laporte (itself owned by Henri Bourgeois), this wine is firmly in the modernist camp of Sancerre. But I also has some complexity, with light, poised flavors of currants and crisp acidity. This is more of a food wine than an apéritif, and would also work well with Asian dishes. Imported by Martine's Wines.",25.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A bit richer than expected, with a slightly oily mouthfeel and mineral and honey aromas. Flavors favor superripe pears, accented by subtle notes of pepper and clove, but finishing clean. Imported by Hand Picked Selections.",17.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"Deiss's top wines are blends of different grape varieties that he feel best express their individual terroirs and vintages. The 2002 Schoenenbourg is intensely mineral and citrusy on the nose, verging on quince-like, but turns out to be rather sweet and a bit soft on the palate, where ripe apple and pear flavors are balanced by dry-mineral notes. A slightly bitter edge creeps in on the finish, which dampened my enthusiasm somewhat for this wine.",95.00,Alsace,Alsace_white_blend
"From a 5-acre parcel, this is a wine that attacks with freshness, and then becomes warm and friendly, showing flavors of almonds, of soft green fruits and a sense of maturity that comes from the hot 2003 vintage and two years' bottle age. Imported by North Berkeley Imports.",52.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Unusually rich for a Pinot Blanc, with scents of honey, dried apricots, peaches and dried spices giving an impression of sweetness that's balanced on the palate by bright acidity that imparts a pineapple flavor. Finishes dry, fresh and minerally. Imported by Atlanta Improvement Co.",13.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"The color of polished brass, this mature late-harvest Gewürz features a floral, perfumed bouquet that hints at spice, pine resin and citrus, as well as the more typical rose petals and lychees. An attractive oiliness gives it a mouthcoating feel, countered by a slightly bitter note on the finish. Drink now.",45.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"This is a soft, rich Sancerre, coming from the warm vineyards of Montigny. There is also just a touch of wood and oxidation, which opens and softens the underlying citrus fruit flavors. With its weight, this is certainly more of a food wine than an apéritif. Imported by Vintage '59 Imports.",23.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"With its bold aromas of spiced pear and crushed stones, this is no wimpy Pinot Blanc. It's round in the mouth, an elegant mélange of stones and stone fruits, alongside pear and melon flavors that finish with mouthwatering length. Imported by Paterno Wines International.",21.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"Packed with bramble, black plums, and  leathery, dense tannins, this is strong stuff. Bitter cocoa flavors and pepper show the ripeness and firmness of the wine, which, at 14.5% alcohol, is no lightweight.",20.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"The chalky soil of Maimbray gives this wine its distinct mineral character. Along with aromas of white flowers are flavors of gooseberries, crisp green plums and a fresh, light structure. Fresh and delicate, this is a great apéritif style of Sancerre. Imported by Weygandt-Metzler.",20.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Deiss's 2002 Engelgarten is a firm, dry, minerally wine that ably wraps anise, green apple and citrus fruits in a cloak of austere minerality. Crisp and clean at this stage, but probably needs several years for more interesting complexities to emerge.",39.00,Alsace,Alsace_white_blend
"Starts off stony and minerally on the nose, but offers more fruit on the palate, where its tart apple and citrus flavors come to the fore. On the full-bodied side for Riesling, with a slight creaminess to the mouthfeel and plush apple and citrus notes on the finish.",38.00,Alsace,Riesling
"A ripe, juicy charmer of a wine, aromatic and perfumed. Raspberry flavors, acidity and soft tannins come together and are underpinned by flavors of new wood and sweetness.",23.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Creamy aromas and layers of almonds, toast and spice make this a fascinating wine that continues to reveal new characters. This is the main white from Vacheron, and the intensity of its fruit comes from the almost biodynamic way in which the family's 98-acre vineyard is cultivated. Imported by North Berkeley Imports.",27.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"This is big in all senses. It has dense, very rich, very powerful fruit and as a consequence of that, it has 14.5% alcohol. It's finely perfumed, with black and violet flavors and aromas, and some good, spicy flavors.",23.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"In 2003, Schlumberger only bottled one grand cru Riesling, leaving the fruit from Saering and Kessler to help beef up this wine. It's a plump yet minerally take on Riesling, with lime, apple and melon aromas and flavors accented by a dry, minerally feel. Picks up a hint of anise on the finish.",20.00,Alsace,Riesling
"A traditional Riesling in the dry style, this wine is crisp and clean to the point of austerity, with the main components reduced to green apple, lime and chalky minerality. Long and tart on the finish. Drink now for its briskness, or try extended aging to see if honeyed complexity emerges in a decade or more.",33.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Lacks the breadth and expansiveness on the palate of Josmeyer's Le Dragon bottling, but features crisp lime and green apple flavors wrapped in a shroud of wet-stone minerality. Picks up a faint anise note on the finish.",27.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Plump and sweet, with plenty of honey aromas and flavors but not much spice, this SGN features hints of Earl Grey tea and low acidity, which shortens the finish.",50.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"Château de Nozet is an amazing fairy-tale castle, the home of the de Ladoucette family. The reputation of its top wine, Baron de L, has been languishing for some time, and this 2003, with its flint and mineral flavors and a touch of spice, is a fine wine but has been outpaced in the Pouilly stakes. Imported by Maisons Marques & Domaines USA.",39.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"This is big and burly, but it's not overweight, and there is some surprising finesse to the wine. A blend of Syrah, Grenache, Carignan, Cinsault and Mourvèdre, it has every flavor of the south, but manages to hang together very well.",30.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Full bodied and verging on soft, this unusual Pinot Blanc from a biodynamic producer shows only modest levels of fruit, but ample weight and texture. Hints of almonds and lacings of licorice add interest.",22.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"Starts off slightly nutty, but also boasts pear and honeysuckle scents. It's smooth and easy to drink, with dried spices accenting ripe pears alongside a hint of cashew. Clean, elegant and citrusy on the finish, even if not overly concentrated. Imported by Teton Selections.",11.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"When your name is Alphonse Mellot, you have little choice but to produce Sancerre, as the family has been doing since 1618. This is his classic white (he also makes a red with the same name), soft, supple, fruity and easy to drink. It shows the ripeness of 2005, leaving the intensity to other, more complex wines. Imported by Commonwealth Wine & Spirits Inc.",20.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Plump and succulent, with an appealing personality that emphasizes melon and peach flavors accented by hints of crushed stone. Not terribly complex, but a charming summer quaff. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",13.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"Immediately attractive currant and gooseberry flavors dominate this easy, very fruity wine. A citrus and green grass layer goes through the wine, leaving freshness, cleanness and wonderful acidity. Imported by Monsieur Touton Selection Ltd.",20.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Now owned by Guy Saget of Pouilly-sur-Loire, Balland-Chapuis is an historic name in Sancerre. This is typical of their classic production, fresh, straightforward, with fine, fresh citrus and gooseberry fruits and a fine, ripe structure. Imported by Serge Dore Selections.",15.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Fat almost to the point of being flabby, this is an intensely aromatic Gewürztraminer loaded with slightly chemical, peppery scents and overtones of honey. Melon fruit gives the roundness on the palate, then finishes soft and easy.",54.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"After a somewhat understated bouquet that only hints at lychee and floral notes, this wine grows more assertive on the palate, broadening out and adding ripe pear flavors. Finishes a bit soft, with more lychee flavors.",25.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"Minerally on the nose, but backed by ample fruit in the form of pineapple, apple and lime scents. Manages to be plump in the mouth, yet tart and citrusy at the same time, finishing long and dry.",12.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Made in a slightly austere style, with steely, minerally notes on the nose and modest citrus (bergamot) flavors in the mouth. Mildly tart on the finish; this really needs food to shine. Imported by Maisons Marques & Domaines USA.",18.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"A distinctive and somewhat mature effort, with honey and nut aromas giving way to flavors that don't show much fruit yet manage to be rich—something akin to mineral or nut oil. Richly textured on the palate, the wine finishes reasonably long, despite not showing much freshness.",18.00,Loire_Valley,Chenin_Blanc
"Well known as a Saumur-based producer of Cremant de Loire, this winery, owned by Bollinger Champagne, also makes this soft, flowery Sancerre. It is ripe and fresh, with layers of citrus fruits and some full, mouthwatering acidity. Imported by Paterno Wines International.",25.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"This is a classic, fresh, straightforward, instantly enjoyable Sauvignon. It has crisp acidity, flavors of green peas and just enough structure to allow it to age for another year. But it's great now, a delicious summer wine. Imported by Kobrand.",24.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"A blend of Pinot Gris, Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier and Pinot Blanc, this wine poses omething of a challenge to the reviewer. The aromas are slightly oxidative, the alcohol levels elevated and yet the wine lacks lushness to balance it's large frame. Instead, hard, crystalline flavors power the palate, leaving the impression of a multifaceted rock. Seems to have stuff worthy of more introspection and intellectual curiosity than our blind-tasting format allows; not a hedonistic bomb by any measure.",95.00,Alsace,Alsace_white_blend
"A fresh, currant-  and green plum-flavored wine that is clean, full of fruit and will develop soon. This is enjoyable already and will make great drinking this summer. Imported by Eagle Eye Imports.",25.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"This classic Sancerre is a fresh, crisp, but intensely fruity wine that still tastes of young green fruits and currants. It has a fine depth of flavor, promising good development. Very crisp green apple flavors to finish. Imported by Vineyard Brands.",24.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Attractively priced for a grand cru wine, but not better than some producers' blended wines. A whiff of diesel adds nuance to the baked-apple aromas, then spice and apple flavors take over on the palate. Sounds good up to then, but the finish strikes a discordant note, adding chalky, almost bitter, flavors.",22.00,Alsace,Riesling
"An open, full wine from Jean-Claude Dagueneau. It has good, soft fruits,  attractive acidity and a touch of almond. Drink now. Imported by Vineyard Brands.",24.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Peppery and gingery on the nose, followed by flavors of pear and melon. This is a broad, sweet, low-acid Gewürztraminer, that's pleasant enough but doesn't show enough concentration or length to rise above good.",20.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"A soft, ripe wine that has almond and herb flavors, a touch of toast and easy acidity. It's fresh, clean and ready to drink now. Imported by Paterno Wines International.",26.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Green apple and pear fruit flavors also carry enough hints of peach and anise to impart a modicum of complexity. Off-dry, but finishes clean—a suitable companion for Chinese takeout. Imported by W.J. Deutsch & Sons.",10.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"Fairly dry as Alsace Gewürz goes these days, with a leaner, tighter mouthfeel and less flamboyant aromas than many. Pear and melon flavors finish with a peppery edge.",27.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"This Pouilly-sur-Loire-based producer also has these Sancerre vineyards in Thauvenay. With just a touch of honey aromas, this is an immediately attractive wine that shows softness and freshness rather than weight. It is very pure, open and ready to drink. Imported by Grape Expectations (CA).",20.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Minty, herbal notes mark the nose, layered over a base of apples and minerals. Lean and a bit ungenerous at first, the herbal, stony, stridently citrusy flavors open up in time to show a touch of honey on the finish.",21.00,Alsace,Riesling
"A plump, medium-bodied white with ripe pear and melon aromas, this is standard fare among Alsace Pinot Blancs. Crisp pear and citrus flavors pick up a hint of anise on the finish. A simple quaffer destined for weeknight dinners at the corner bistro. Imported by Cellar Door Selections.",12.00,Alsace,Pinot_Blanc
"Opens with a blast of zesty lemon-lime fruit, then turns slightly sweet in the mouth, with the flavors moving toward ripe or maybe even baked apples. Finshes soft, with a hint of cinnamon.",27.00,Alsace,Riesling
"There's a wild, natural streak to this wine of garrigue herbs and game matched with fruit notes of dark cherry and plum guts. The medium-weight mouth is juicy but offers nice structre with dusty tannins and a fudgy finish. Drink now.",15.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"Soft and rounded, this is an open style of Chardonnay from one of the great white wine values in the Côte d'Or of Burgundy. The wine has richness, wood layers, flavors of peach, herbs and vanilla. It is attractively ready to drink now.",26.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Orange-tinted rosé, a rounded, soft and peach-flavored wine. It has fine freshness, soft acidity and a ripe aftertaste. An attractive apéritif style.",48.00,Champagne,Champagne_Blend
"Attractively colored wine with red berry fruits and an edge of bitter cherries, almonds and perfumed acidity. The wine is structured, spicy, full-bodied in character.",21.00,Provence,Rosé
"Assertive aromas of rosemary, thyme and laurel dominate the bouquet of this medium-weight wine. Flavors of high-toned black cherry and boysenberry keep the mouth fresh and the finish mouthwatering.",17.00,Languedoc-Roussillon,Rhône-style_Red_Blend
"A soft, open style of wine. Fresh, ripe strawberry flavors give sweetness, without much balancing tannin. The finish is soft, sweet, like children's pink candy.",33.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Ripe, full bodied and still young, this generous wine is open with its fresh apples and creamy texture that give richness. A touch of toastiness adds to the complexity and potential of the wine. Drink now, although it will be better from the end of 2016.",25.00,Burgundy,Chardonnay
"Aging in big wood barrels has softened the intensity of this wine while leaving the fruitiness intact. It makes for a tangy, mineral-driven wine with a smoky, flinty aftertaste. Drink from 2017.",26.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Vines planted on gravel soil line a terrace above the Cher river. This wine with an intensely herbal character is fresh, crisp and packed with fruit. It has some weight, along with a great lift from the aromatic aftertaste. The wine can be drunk now, although it will be better from 2017.",18.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Rich and full in mouth, this has green and apple fruit flavors that are cut with acidity. The tangy texture gives a contrast and balance to the wine. Drink from 2017.",22.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Coming from a classic limestone vineyard, this is tense, structured and tight. It is textured, with spice and tangy acidity giving some complexity to the otherwise fruity wine. Drink from 2017.",25.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
Organically grown grapes from one of the top Provence estates have produced this light grey-pink colored wine. It is a delicious fruity confection of bright red berries and tangy acidity. There is an attractive touch of minerality to give the wine structure. Drink now.,24.00,Provence,Rosé
"This is a ripe beautifully balanced wine. It has the extra richness and density that comes from a vine produced in the close to Monte Sainte-Victoire. Full of raspberry and orange fruits, the wine has a final tangy herbal edge. Drink now.",20.00,Provence,Rosé
"This is a dark and probably too-tannic wine. A very dry, extracted character gives bitterness more than fruit. It's still young and has the Saint-Estèphe tannins in abundance, although its future with this dryness is uncertain.",30.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Packed with fruit, this is a fine, simple Bordeaux. Red fruits leap out of the glass, allied to light tannins. They make for a wine that's ready to drink young and fresh.",15.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Firm, dry tannins behind this wine give a hard edge that will need time. The wine is powered by its structure, solid and only just fruity. Wait until at least 2017 to allow more fruitiness to come through, although the wine will likely always be tough.",12.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"This is a simple, fruity wine without great tannic structure. It has attractive berry fruits and a dry core. With its fresh acidity, it will be ready to drink soon.",25.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Dominated by the local Duras grape, this spicy and fruity wine has an intriguing blend of juicy acidity and leathery tannins. It gives a wine that could benefit from aging while also being ready to drink now. Give it the benefit of the doubt and wait until 2016.",16.00,Southwest_France,Red_Blend
"The juicy acidity is the dominant character of this wine, with its very fresh red plum and raspberry flavors. It is pure fruit, tightened by small tannins, but keeping that acidity always at the front. Imported by Robert Kacher Imports.",24.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Solid, mainstream Riesling, combining apple and citrus aromas and flavors in a medium-bodied format. Tangerines and limes accent green apples in this simple, fresh wine.",25.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Intriguing—but strange—stuff, with herbal-grassy aromas and a smoky note, then more weird herbal notes on the palate, including dill and pine resin. Seems a touch sweet, then turns drying on the finish. An adventure in biodynamic winemaking.",38.00,Alsace,Riesling
"This blending for the American market is softer than some Sancerre, but has some good fresh currant and light lemon flavors. It's ready to drink, with its soft, clean acidity. Imported by House of Burgundy.",19.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Opens with spice aromas that seem a bit unusual, ranging from ginger to clove and anise. In the mouth, it's medium-bodied, with flavors of stones and citrus, without much ripe fruit character.",21.00,Alsace,Riesling
"Atypically light in body and reticent on the nose, this Gewürz instead shows rather crisp lime and green apple flavors. It's fresh and mouthwatering, if not exactly what you might expect from a Gewürztraminer.",15.00,Alsace,Gewürztraminer
"This fruity, light wine is full of red berries. The tannins are there, playing a supporting role to the intense fruitiness and acidity that's typical of the vintage. This wine will develop quickly, so drink from 2017.",32.00,Burgundy,Pinot_Noir
"Very herbal and grassy, this crisp wine emphasizes fruit rather than texture. It is ripe, fruity with citrus and gooseberry flavors that are heightened by the acidity. It's a wine to drink now.",20.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"Produced from young vines, this is a fresh, fruity, and crisp wine. It has attractive apple and pear flavors, brightened further by citrus overtones. Drink this attractive wine now.",29.00,Loire_Valley,Sauvignon_Blanc
"The estate wine of Coutinel is dominated by the local Négrette grape. With the addition of 15% Syrah and (unusual for this part of the world) 15% Gamay, the wine is structured while also juicy. Soft tannins and black fruits are shot through with an attractive perfumed character. Drink from 2018.",16.00,Southwest_France,Red_Blend
"This estate wine is packed with attractive fruit. With grapefruit and orange-zest flavors, it is tightly crisp. Set against that are the ripe red-currant and berry fruitiness, layers of acidity and a pinch of pepper. Drink this refreshing wine now.",25.00,Provence,Rosé
"This is an attractive blend of Grenache and Syrah, giving a smooth wine that has just the right amount of acidity. Red currant and Bartlett pear flavors give the wine its fruity side. It is ready to drink.",18.00,Provence,Rosé
"The main estate wine from Roubine is a rich, ripe and fruity with a light edge of spice. It has a soft character, the result of the malolactic fermentation reducing the acidity. That gives a great balance between the red fruits and tangy zesty aftertaste. Drink now.",23.00,Provence,Rosé
"Under the same ownership as Château Roubine, this estate has old vines, some up to 60-years-old. The wine is rich and with concentration as well as a crisper edge. It is full of red-berry fruits, sharpened with red-currant acidity. This is a ripe wine that will be better from late 2017.",13.00,Provence,Rosé
"Pacherenc wines are the white counterpart to red Madiran, grown in the same area. This dry wine is a blend of Gros and Petit Manseng and the rare Arrufiac. It is a lightly honeyed wine with fine acidity and a really juicy fruity citrus and white-fruit-flavored aftertaste. Drink now.",17.00,Southwest_France,White_Blend
This is a powerfully ripe wine. It has layers of great black fruits and firm tannins. Both indicate a wine for aging. It has a concentrated juicy character along with acidity and a dry structured core. Drink this wine from 2019.,16.00,Southwest_France,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
"Here's a solid wine full of both tannins and dark fruits. New oak barrels give a spicy character while supporting the fruitiness. A blend of 70% Merlot and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon from only 10 acres, it is developing into a rich wine that still needs time. Drink this impressive wine from 2018.",19.00,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend
